While Imada et al. (2022) replicated the original finding that people expect others to be more willing to help when they are offered medium amount of cash compared to small amount of cash. However, while Heyman and Ariely (2004) found no significant difference in expected willingness help between those who are offered low amount of goods and medium amount of goods, Imada et al. (2022) found that people expect others to be more willing to help when they are offered with medium amount of goods compared to small amount of goods. Yet, the effect size (medium vs. small) for money was much larger than that for goods, and their replications overall supported the original claim that the sensitivity to compensation level differs depending on money vs. social market relationships."
