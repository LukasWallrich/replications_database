* 
**Elderly priming**, that hearing about old age makes people walk slower.


    * Status: reversed
    * Original paper: '[Automaticity of social behavior](https://scholar.google.com/scholar?cluster=3335859380278379099&hl=en&as_sdt=0,5&sciodt=0,5)', Bargh (1996); 2 experiments with Study 2a: n = 30, Study 2b: n = 30[citations = 5938(GS, October 2021)]​

#### 
    Hostility priming (unscrambled sentences) 




* 
**Hostility priming (unscrambled sentences)**. Exposing participants to more hostility-related stimuli caused them subsequently to interpret ambiguous behaviours as more hostile. 


    * Status: not replicated
    * Original paper: [The role of category accessibility in the interpretation of information about persons: Some determinants and implications.](http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.335.4255&rep=rep1&type=pdf) Srull  and Wyer, Jr. (1979); 2 experiments with Study 1:  n = 96; Study 2: n = 96 [  2409 citations (GS, November 2021)].

#### 
    Intelligence priming (contemplation)




* 
**Intelligence priming (contemplation)**, alt term = **professor priming.** Participants primed with a category associated with intelligence (e.g. “professor”) performed 13% better on a trivia test than participants primed with a category associated with a lack of intelligence (“soccer hooligans”).


    * Status: not replicated
    * Original paper: [The relation between perception and behavior, or how to win a game of trivial pursuit](https://psycnet.apa.org/buy/1998-01060-003), Dijksterhuis  and van Knippenberg, 1998, 4 experiments with Study 1: n = 60; Study 2: n = 58; Study 3: n = 95; Study 4: n = 43.

#### 
    Distance priming




* 
**Distance priming**. Participants primed with distance compared to closeness produced greater enjoyment of media depicting embarrassment (Study 1), less emotional distress from violent media (Study 2), lower estimates of the number of calories in unhealthy food (Study 3), and weaker reports of emotional attachments to family members and hometowns (Study 4).

#### Mortality Salience

A second original paper was by [Goldberg et al. (2001)](http://dx.doi.org/10.1037/0096-3445.130.3.427) who observed that participants primed with questions about their death provided more positive evaluations to an essay describing humans as distinct from animals than control participants presented with questions regarding another aversive situation (d = 1.13).

    * Replication effect size: [Klein et al. (2018)](https://psyarxiv.com/vef2c): Regardless of which exclusion criteria were used, the predicted effect was not observed, and the confidence interval was quite narrow: Exclusion Set 1: _Hedges’ g_ = 0.03, 95% CI = [-0.06, 0.12]; Exclusion Set 2: _Hedges’ g_ = 0.06, 95% CI = [-0.06, 0.17] Exclusion Set 3: _Hedges’ g_ = 0.04, 95% CI = [-0.07, 0.16]; for this reason, they were unable to further assess if original author involvement influenced the replication results. [Sætrevik & Sjåstad 2019](https://psyarxiv.com/dkg53/): _d _= -0.08 – 0.35 for outcome effects related to theoretical predictions. The effect size found by [Rodríguez-Ferreiro et al.

**Social class on prosocial behaviour**. Individuals from a high social class are more likely to exhibit prosocial behavior than those from a low social class, but there is a U-shaped curve between social class and prosocial behavior that sometimes appears.

    Stanford Prison Experiment




* 
**Stanford Prison Experiment** employed a simulation of a prison environment to  examine the psychological effects of coercive situations. Utilizing role-playing, labeling and social expectations it showed that one third of participants in the role of prison guards displayed aggressive and dehumanizing behaviour.


    * Status: NA
    * Original paper: '[Interpersonal dynamics in a simulated prison](http://pdf.prisonexp.org/ijcp1973.pdf)', Haney, Banks, Zimbardo (1973)  [n=24, citations: [2115](https://scholar.google.com/scholar?um=1&ie=UTF-8&lr&cites=9776461194085021745) (including highly referenced publications), (GS, January, 2022)].
    * Critiques: First, the study has been criticized for the lack of adherence to the experimental methodology. Although the study has been widely described as an ‘experiment’ it lacks many defining features: 1) it does not define the precise set of manipulated variables, 2) it manipulates multiple variables at time without the proper control over the effects of each one, 3) it does not define the dependent variable and how it will be measured, 4) it does not state any clear hypotheses. It is noteworthy that in the original paper, authors present their work as a “demonstration” not an experiment. Second group of serious issues is the degree of researchers’ ad-hoc interventions that were influencing the behaviour of the participants. One of the leading researchers, Philip F. Zimbardo took part in the experimental procedure as the prisons’ “Superintendent”. Another close collaborator of the research team David Jaffe, who initially conceived the idea of the mock-prison study, was playing the role of the “Warden”. Considering that these people knew the goal of the study and were, as later admitted,  interested in the particular outcome (a call for reform of the prison system), the ad-hoc intervention, such as encouraging some of the guards to be more strict and ‘tough’, cast a reasonable doubt on the role of experimentator' expectations on the final results of the study. The third group of issues is sampling. Namely, the study has been conducted on a small (n=24, n per condition = 12) and largely unrepresentative sample (all males, all college students of similar age, all residents of the United States). Also, despite the screening procedures of the voluntarily applying candidates, it is still possible that a strong ‘demand characteristic’ and ‘self-selection bias’ may have affected the composition of the sample. All the participants have responded to the newspaper ad about wanting help in  “psychological study of prison life”. The last issue with the Stanford Prison Experiment is the interpretation of the results. Even if the discovered effect is trustworthy (and above mentioned issues put this into questions), there is no clear theoretical interpretation of what this finding actually proves. Some critics argue that violent behaviour of the guards may be rooted in their following of a strong leadership, rather than from their immersion into attributed social role. Some specific works addressing criticism to the original study are listed as follows:  \

    Milgram experiment 




* 
**Milgram experiment **was a study examining the influence of authority on the immoral behaviour. Participants were assigned the role of ‘teachers’ and they were instructed by the experimentator to administer electric shocks** **of** **15-450 V voltage, whenever the ‘learner’  made a mistake. There were various variants of the study. In the most basic one, 100% of participants agree to administer a 300 V shock and 65% agreed to apply to maximum shock of 450 V.

(~6600 citations). (The full range of conditions was [n=740](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3976349/).)
    * Critiques: Experiment was riddled with** **researcher degrees of freedom, going off-script, implausible agreement between very different treatments, and “only half of the people who undertook the experiment fully believed it was real and of those, 66% disobeyed the experimenter.” Sources: [Burger 2011](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/1948550610397632), [Perry 2012](https://thenewpress.com/books/behind-shock-machine), [Brannigan 2013](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s12115-013-9724-3); [Griggs 2016 \

    * Original effect size: 65% of subjects said to administer maximum, dangerous voltage.
    * Replication effect size: [Doliński 2017](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/1948550617693060?journalCode=sppa) is relatively careful, n=80, and found comparable effects to Milgram. Burger (n=70) also finds similar levels of compliance to Milgram, but the level didn't scale with the strength of the experimenter prods (see Table 5: the only real order among the prompts led to universal disobedience), so whatever was going on, it's not obedience. [One selection of follow-up studies](http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.694.7724&rep=rep1&type=pdf) found average compliance of 63%, but suffer from the usual publication bias and tiny samples. (Selection was by a student of Milgram.) The most you can say is that there's weak evidence for compliance, rather than obedience. ("Milgram's interpretation of his findings has been largely rejected.").

    Robbers Cave Study 




* 
**Robbers Cave Study**. Utilized arbitrary groupings to demonstrate that tribalism between groups arises spontaneously, and depending on the context, it can result in group competition (e.g., in case of scarce resources) or group cooperation (e.g., in case of superordinate goals and common obstacles)**. **

Overall, the effect accounts to more than 4000 total citations including the [SciAm piece](http://patrick-fournier.com/d/cours13-3140.pdf).
    * Critiques:  No good evidence that tribalism arises spontaneously following arbitrary groupings and scarcity, within weeks, and leads to inter-group violence. The “spontaneous” conflict among children at Robbers Cave was orchestrated by experimenters; tiny sample (maybe 70?); an exploratory study taken as inferential; no control group; there were really three experimental groups - that is, the experimenters had full power to set expectations and endorse deviance; results from their two other studies, with negative results, were not reported. Set aside the ethics: the total absence of consent - the boys and parents had no idea they were in an experiment - or the plan to set the forest on fire and leave the boys to it. Some specific works addressing criticism to the original study are listed as follows:

**Implicit bias testing for racism**. Implicit bias scores poorly predict actual bias, r = [0.15](https://lnu.se/globalassets/lmdswp201511.pdf).

#### Minimal group effect (MGE) 



* 
**Minimal group effect** (MGE), alt-term = **Minimal group paradigm**. An intergroup bias that manifests as ingroup favouritism (i.e., a tendency to prefer ingroup members) when participants are assigned to previously unfamiliar, experimentally created and largely meaningless social identities.

    * Original effect size: 36.8% of the responses were incorrect (influenced by the majority). The effect has been interpreted by the author as evidence for the prevalence of independence (“_The preponderance of judgments was independent, evidence that under the present conditions the force of the perceived data far exceeded that of the majority._”, Asch, 1956, p.24). Nevertheless, the majority of academic textbooks present the study as evidence for overwhelming conformity, failing to report the evidence of independent tendencies among participants (see: Friend et al., 1990, Griggs, 2015). A common practice seen in many academic textbooks and popular writings is to report the value of “75%” or “76%” as the general indicator of conformity. In reality, this is the fraction of respondents who yielded to the majority in at least one of the twelve trials. The reversal of this value (rarely mentioned in the literature) would be 24% - a fraction of completely independent respondents or 95% - a fraction of respondents who remain independent in at least one of twelve trials.

[A meta-analysis of 98 studies](https://psyarxiv.com/svjru/) finds d= 0.2 [0.14, 0.26] with an absurdly low p value, and doesn't find publication bias. But this latter point simply can't be right. Given d = 0.2 and the convention of targeting 80% power to detect a real phenomenon, you would need very high sample sizes, n > 500. And almost all of the included studies are N &lt; 100. [Schimmack](https://replicationindex.com/2017/09/04/the-power-of-the-pen-paradigm-a-replicability-analysis/) finds strong evidence of publication bias on a subset of these papers, using a proper power analysis. Direct replications of the original pen-in-mouth protocol fail; but new conceptual replications appear to work.

    * Meta-analytic estimate: d= 0.2 [0.14, 0.26]. No evidence of publication bias but d = 0.2 and targeting 80% to detect a real phenomenon one needs more than 500 participants. All included studies have only less than 100.<span style="text-decoration:underline;"> [Schimmack](https://replicationindex.com/2017/09/04/the-power-of-the-pen-paradigm-a-replicability-analysis/)</span> finds strong evidence of publication bias on a subset of these papers, using a proper power analysis. \
98 pieces of very weak evidence cannot sum to strong evidence, whatever the p-value says. ([The author agrees](https://twitter.com/coles_nicholas_/status/1116706173833576450).).

#### Ego depletion



* 
**Ego depletion**. Self-control is a limited resource that can be depleted by efforts to inhibit a thought, emotion or behaviour.


    * Status: not replicated
    * Original paper: '[Ego Depletion: Is the Active Self a Limited Resource?](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9599441)', Baumeister 1998, n=67 [citations = 7141 (GS, September 2022)].

#### Dunning-Kruger effect



* 
**Dunning-Kruger effect.** A cognitive bias whereby people with limited knowledge or competence in a given intellectual or social domain greatly overestimate their own knowledge or competence in that domain relative to objective criteria or to the performance of their peers or of people in general. Involves five claims, three of which are just popular misunderstandings: \
1) the one the authors actually make: that poor performers (e.g. the bottom quartile) overestimate their performance more than good performers do: L > U.

![alt_text](images/image1.png "image_tooltip")
  \

5) the authors' explanation: that (1) is caused by a lack of 'metacognitive' skills, being able to reflect on your ability at the task. That it's a cognitive bias suffered by the worst at a task. Incompetence, like anosognosia, not only causes poor performance but also the inability to recognize that one's performance is poor.

    * Original effect size: [Glenberg & Kaschak ](https://link.springer.com/article/10.3758/BF03196313)(2002) Experiment 1 found an ACE interaction (faster response times when the direction of the sentence and the direction of the action match than when they mismatch) of 155ms, against an average response time of about 1766ms, for actions involving transfer of concrete objects. This amounts to just less than a 9% effect in response time. In Experiment 2a they found an ACE interaction of 170ms against an average of response time of 1871ms; again, a 9% response time effect.

Figure 2 shows the estimated ACE interaction for all participants in all labs. As can be seen, the median ACE interactions are close to 0 and all within the range that we pre-specified as negligible and inconsistent with the existing ACE literature (&lt;100ms).” The average ACE was not significantly different from 0 at traditional α levels (F = 0.121, p = 0.728, average d= 0.0036).

**Risk and Goal Message Framing**



* **Risk and Goal Message Framing.** a) For illness detection behaviors, loss framing (presenting information of negative consequences with undesirable behaviors / without desirable behaviors) would be more effective than gain framing (presenting information of benefits through engaging in desirable behaviors) in encouraging healthy attitudes, intentions, and behaviors (perhaps because illness detection behaviors are riskier, Rothman & Salovey, 1997), whereas b) for health-affirming behaviors, gain framing would be more effective than loss framing in motivating healthy attitudes, intentions, behaviors (perhaps because health-affirming behaviors are less risky, Rothman & Salovey, 1997).
    * Status: Mixed, depending on operationalizations, DVs, and method (meta-analysis vs empirical study). The conceptual replication failed to provide support for the interaction, but this may be due to limited power.

The proposed phenomenon that people associate or experience stronger regret with action compared to inaction in the short-term, but stronger regret with inaction compared to action in the long-term. Studies 1 (lifetime general regret), 3, and 4 (hypothetical scenario experiments) of Gilovich and Medvec (1994) were successfully replicated by Yeung and Feldman (2022), but Yeung and Feldman (2022) (direct replication) and some others (conceptual replications) failed to find support for temporal pattern of regret in real-life experience studies (Bonnefon & Zhang, 2008; Feldman et al., 1999; Towers et al., 2016)..​

    Money Market versus Goods/Social Market

* **Money Market versus Goods/Social Market. **The money market relationship refers to an exchange in which effort level is determined based on the level of compensation. By contrast, the social market relationship is an exchange in which effort level is most influenced by altruistic motivations rather than the compensation level. Heyman and Ariely (2004) proposed and showed that when the former is primed with monetary compensation, the more compensation they receive, the more effort they displayed. Yet, effort level did not vary depending on the level of compensation when the latter is primed with non-monetary compensation (i.e., goods), effort level do not depend on compensation level. ​

While Imada et al. (2022) replicated the original finding that people expect others to be more willing to help when they are offered medium amount of cash compared to small amount of cash. However, while Heyman and Ariely (2004) found no significant difference in expected willingness help between those who are offered low amount of goods and medium amount of goods, Imada et al. (2022) found that people expect others to be more willing to help when they are offered with medium amount of goods compared to small amount of goods. Yet, the effect size (medium vs. small) for money was much larger than that for goods, and their replications overall supported the original claim that the sensitivity to compensation level differs depending on money vs. social market relationships.

The affective response to an event is enhanced if its causes are abnormal (Kahneman & Miller, 1986). Exceptionality effect is the phenomenon that people associate stronger negative affect with a negative outcome when it is a result of an exception (abnormal behaviour) compared to when it is a result of routine (normal behaviour, Fillon et al., 2020). . The exceptionality enhances the response to an event for the emotion of regret, self-blame, the cognitive response for victim compensation and offender punishment (Fillon et al., 2020).

#### Choice overload



* 
**Choice overload**, the idea that giving people too many choices can lead to certain undesirable consequences such as reduced purchasing intentions, is in doubt, but most people don’t consider it to be discredited. 


    * Status: Mixed (dueling meta-analyses, mix of successful and failed replications). It would probably require a systematic, multi-lab replication approach to sort this out at this point.
    * Original study: [When choice is demotivating](https://www.cs.bgu.ac.il/~ehv192/wiki.files/Choice_is_Demotivating%20Can%20one%20desire%20too%20much%20%20.pdf), Iyengar & Lepper, 2000. In the original field experiment with exotic jams where # of flavors were manipulated (24 vs. 6), more stopped to browse the larger selection (60% vs 40%), but more purchased from the smaller selection (30% (31) vs. 3% (4)) (Iyengar and Lepper 2000). 3 experiments with n=249,193,. [citations=4897(GS,October 2021)].
    * Critiques: Scheibehenne (2008) failed to directly replicate Iyengar and Lepper (2000) jam study. Greifeneder (2008) did a lab experiment with chocolates and also failed to conceptually replicate. These replication failures are not definitive because there have been many studies (too many to list) in which the effect was (conceptually) replicated in some fashion.
    * Original effect size: d=0.77 (study1) and d=0.29 (study2), and d=0.88 (study3) (as calculated from the X^2 values in the text with [this](https://www.polyu.edu.hk/mm/effectsizefaqs/calculator/calculator.html) online calculator) 
    * Replication effect sizes: 
        * [Scheibehenne et al. 2010](https://academic.oup.com/jcr/article-abstract/37/3/409/1827647): “We found a mean effect size of virtually zero” (d=.02) [citations=1049(GS,October 2021)].
        * Chernev et al. 2010: That’s because many of the studies were designed to show instances when there is no effect. You need to split the data into “choice is good” vs. “choice is bad.”
        * Simonsohn et al. 2014: We agree with Chernev et al. (2010). When we split it up, we found that the choice is bad studies (choice overload) lack collective evidential value (uniform _p_-curve). 
        * Chernev et al. 2015: &lt;ignoring Simonsohn et al. 2014> Choice overload is a reliable effect under certain conditions (moderators).

Study 2: N=137; women in the mate guarding condition are asked to imagine they are at a party with their date and another woman is flirting with their date. The activation of a mate guarding motive increases women’s desire for conspicuous consumption. Study 3: N=115; replicates study 2 and shows that a mate guarding motive only increases desire for conspicuous goods. Study 4: N=75; the activation of a mate guarding motive increases women’s spending on luxurious accessories, but only when these accessories are visible to other women. Study 5: N=175; shows that displaying luxurious goods  dissuades other women from pursuing a relationship with a taken man. [citation=450 (GS, January 2022)]​.

Study 1 did not replicate the original findings that women with luxurious goods are perceived by other women as having devoted partners. In study 2, a reversal is observed, such that women with non-designer possessions were perceived to have a more devoted partner than women with designer possessions.

People homozygous for the “short” allele (s/s) are significantly more likely to experience depression than people homozygous for the “long” allele (l/l) after multiple stressful life events; heterozygotes (s/l) demonstrate an intermediate response.

    * Original effect size: Participants perform better on conceptual application questions when taking longhand notes compared to using a laptop, _d _ = .38, p = .046 [calculated]. Experiment 2, Conceptual application questions, d = .41 [calculated]. Experiment 3 assessed the interaction between note-taking medium (longhand vs. laptop) and studying: among students who had the opportunity to study, longhand note takers did significantly better than laptop note takers, p = .024, d = 0.64 on conceptual questions. Non-significant effects are reported for factual recall and therefore not reported here.
    * Replication effect size: taking Urry et al. (2021). The effect in the replication study was negligible in the opposite direction (Hedges’s g = −0.13, 95% CI = [−0.45, 0.20]); significantly different from the original effect, t(139.03) = −2.78, p = .003. .016 From a mini-meta analysis of eight studies, Urry et al. (2021)  found that taking notes longhand as opposed to with a laptop boosted total quiz performance across factual and conceptual item types to a negligible degree (Hedges’s g = 0.04, 95% CI = [−0.13, 0.20]). This effect was not statistically significant (z = 0.46, p = .645).
