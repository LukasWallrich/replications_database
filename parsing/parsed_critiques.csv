Social Psychology,Personal cognitive dissonance - free-choice paradigm,"Personal cognitive dissonance, from the cognitive dissonance theory (Festinger, 1957), suggests that an inconsistency between two cognitions (e.g., an attitude and a past behaviour) creates an unpleasant psychological state (i.e., personal dissonance) that the individual is motivated to reduce (e.g., by changing one of the elements to fit the other). This personal cognitive dissonance has been studied in the literature through different paradigms, including the following three main ones: free-choice, induced-compliance and induced-hypocrisy paradigm. The mere act of choosing equally desirable options can arouse dissonance in the individual, because choosing option A implies the rejection of option B (in other words, choosing option A means accepting its advantages but also its disadvantages, but also accepting to deprive oneself of the advantages of option B). In order to reduce dissonance, subjects will increase the perceived gap between options (i.e., spreading of alternatives) by overestimating the chosen option and/or underestimating the rejected option. ​",Enisman et al. 2021,https://doi.org/10.1037/pspa0000263,10.1037/pspa0000263,"meta-analyse; n = 43 studies,","11 (GS, February 2023)",43

Social Psychology,Personal cognitive dissonance - induced-hypocrisy paradigm,"Personal cognitive dissonance - Induced-hypocrisy paradigm**. In this paradigm, dissonance is aroused by making individuals aware of the discrepancy between a socially desirable behaviour (e.g., not wasting water; stage 1: normative commitment phase) and their own past transgressive behaviours (e.g., remembering one's past water waste; stage 2: transgression salience phase). Most of the dissonance reduction work is done through behavioural means, and leads subjects to express behavioural intentions, and/or perform behaviours in the direction of the socially desirable behaviours expressed in step 1 (i.e., allowing for the reduction of the inconsistency between the norm, step 1, and the recall of transgressions, step 2).​",Priolo et al. 2019,https://doi.org/10.1177/0146167219841621,10.1177/0146167219841621,"meta-analyse; k = 38 studies,","38 (GS, February 2023)",

As a personal cognitive dissonance, the inconsistency between two cognitions (e.g., between attitude and observed behaviour) creates an unpleasant psychological state (i.e., vicarious dissonance) that the individual is motivated to reduce (e.g., by changing one of the elements to fit the other). This vicarious cognitive dissonance has been studied in the literature through different paradigms, including the following two main ones: induced-compliance and induced-hypocrisy paradigm. In this paradigm, subjects are led to observe the realisation, by a member of their in-group, of a counter-attitudinal act with their own norms or social norms (e.g., agree to perform a counter-attitudinal act), performed in a context of free choice.
