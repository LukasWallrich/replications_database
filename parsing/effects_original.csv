Social Psychology,Personal cognitive dissonance - free-choice paradigm,"Personal cognitive dissonance, from the cognitive dissonance theory (Festinger, 1957), suggests that an inconsistency between two cognitions (e.g., an attitude and a past behaviour) creates an unpleasant psychological state (i.e., personal dissonance) that the individual is motivated to reduce (e.g., by changing one of the elements to fit the other). This personal cognitive dissonance has been studied in the literature through different paradigms, including the following three main ones: free-choice, induced-compliance and induced-hypocrisy paradigm. The mere act of choosing equally desirable options can arouse dissonance in the individual, because choosing option A implies the rejection of option B (in other words, choosing option A means accepting its advantages but also its disadvantages, but also accepting to deprive oneself of the advantages of option B). In order to reduce dissonance, subjects will increase the perceived gap between options (i.e., spreading of alternatives) by overestimating the chosen option and/or underestimating the rejected option. ​",NA.
Social Psychology,Personal cognitive dissonance - induced-compliance paradigm,"In this paradigm, subjects are led to perform, in a context of free choice, an inconsistent act with their own norms or social norms (e.g., agree to perform a counter-attitudinal act).

Social Psychology,Personal cognitive dissonance - induced-hypocrisy paradigm,"Personal cognitive dissonance - Induced-hypocrisy paradigm**. In this paradigm, dissonance is aroused by making individuals aware of the discrepancy between a socially desirable behaviour (e.g., not wasting water; stage 1: normative commitment phase) and their own past transgressive behaviours (e.g., remembering one's past water waste; stage 2: transgression salience phase). Most of the dissonance reduction work is done through behavioural means, and leads subjects to express behavioural intentions, and/or perform behaviours in the direction of the socially desirable behaviours expressed in step 1 (i.e., allowing for the reduction of the inconsistency between the norm, step 1, and the recall of transgressions, step 2).​","Effect of induced-hypocrisy on behavioural intention: r = .58 [.32, .75]​."
Social Psychology,Vicarious cognitive dissonance - induced-compliance paradigm,"Vicarious cognitive dissonance, from the cognitive dissonance theory (Festinger, 1957; see “personal cognitive dissonance”), suggests that it would be possible for an individual to experience dissonance vicariously when they witness the performance of inconsistent act (e.g., counter-attitudinal or counter-normative behaviour) on the part of an in-group member with whom they strongly identify. As a personal cognitive dissonance, the inconsistency between two cognitions (e.g., between attitude and observed behaviour) creates an unpleasant psychological state (i.e., vicarious dissonance) that the individual is motivated to reduce (e.g., by changing one of the elements to fit the other). This vicarious cognitive dissonance has been studied in the literature through different paradigms, including the following two main ones: induced-compliance and induced-hypocrisy paradigm. In this paradigm, subjects are led to observe the realisation, by a member of their in-group, of a counter-attitudinal act with their own norms or social norms (e.g., agree to perform a counter-attitudinal act), performed in a context of free choice. Dissonance can be resolved through multiple modes of reduction (e.g., social support, trivialization, ect.), but attitude change remains the most studied mode of reduction.​","Effect of vicarious dissonance on attitude change: d = 0.70 [0.21, 1.26]."

Most of the dissonance reduction work is done through behavioural means, and leads subjects to express behavioural intentions, and/or perform behaviours in the direction of the socially desirable behaviours expressed in step 1 (i.e., allowing for the reduction of the inconsistency between the norm, step 1, and the recall of transgressions, step 2).​","Effect of induced-hypocrisy on behavioural intention: d = 0.70 [0.12, 1.26]​."

Chimpanzees (_Pan troglodytes_) choose risky options more than bonobos (_Pan paniscus_) in risky choice tasks providing choices between guaranteed and risky food rewards. Heilbronner et al. (2008) found chimpanzees preferred risky options more than bonobos at the Leipzig Zoo. Rosati and Hare (2013) confirmed this finding in a group of chimpanzees and bonobos at Tchimpounga Chimpanzee Sanctuary in Republic of Congo,"d = 4.80 [2.08, 7.46] (calculated)."
Evolutionary Linguistics,Typological Prevalence Hypothesis: Learnability of semantics (evidentiality),"Typological Prevalence Hypothesis.** The typological prevalence hypothesis is a proposal that suggests that certain structural features are more common across languages than others due to factors such as ease of learning, processing, and use. These more prevalent structural features are thought to be more likely to be retained in a language over time. Claims that  cross-linguistically more prevalent distinctions are easier to learn, or the more common a certain distinction or way of categorising across languages, the more cognitively natural (and easily learnable) for humans it should be. This effect is explored for the grammatical structure of evidentiality, or grammatical marking of information source in an utterance",NA.
Speech Language Therapy,Stuttering and bilingualism,Bilingual children had an increased risk of stuttering and a lower chance of recovery from stuttering than language exclusive and monolingual speakers,Cramer’s V = 0.34.  
Speech Language Therapy,Stuttering and self-esteem,"Children who stutter have higher self-esteem than children who do not stutter. However, the self-esteem of children who stutter declines once they reach adolescence","M(SD)stuttering boys = 56.5 (25.9), M(SD)boys normgroup: 36.5(25.9); M(SD)stuttering girls = 43.1(35.8), M(SD)girls normgroup=27.7(25.7)."

Experimental Philosophy,Fake barn cases,“Older participants are less likely than younger participants to attribute knowledge in fake-barn cases”,r = −0.32.
Experimental Philosophy,Stakes effect,"alternative terms = a subset of interest-relative invariantism, interest-relativity of knowledge, bank cases). Knowledge is sensitive to stakes. According to the [Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy](https://plato.stanford.edu/ENTRIES/experimental-philosophy/#Epis), ""a number of early findings from the experimental epistemology literature suggested that people's ordinary knowledge attributions actually don't depend on stakes",Responses are on a 7-point Likert scale. Mean response in low stakes (LS-NA) group = 5.07 to mean response in high stakes (HS-NA) group = 5.33.
Personality Psychology,Fear conditioning - Anxiety,"Fear conditioning - effect of trait anxiety/neuroticism on conditioning**. High trait anxiety/neuroticism leads to better fear conditioning. Evidence is mixed; some papers even find the reversed effect, depending on experimental paradigm (in particular, single-cue conditioning versus differential conditioning).​",NA
