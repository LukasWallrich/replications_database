Discipline,Effect,Description
Social Psychology,Elderly priming,that hearing about old age makes people walk slower.
Social Psychology,Hostility priming (unscrambled sentences),Exposing participants to more hostility-related stimuli caused them subsequently to interpret ambiguous behaviours as more hostile.
Social Psychology,Intelligence priming (contemplation),* **Intelligence priming (contemplation) (professor priming).** Participants primed with a category associated with intelligence (e.g. “professor”) performed 13% better on a trivia test than participants primed with a category associated with a lack of intelligence (“soccer hooligans”).
Social Psychology,Moral priming (cleanliness),Participants exposed to physical cleanliness were shown to reduce the severity of their moral judgments.
Social Psychology,Moral priming (contemplation),Participants exposed to a moral-reminder prime would demonstrate reduced cheating.
Social Psychology,Distance priming,"Participants primed with distance compared to closeness produced greater enjoyment of media depicting embarrassment (Study 1), less emotional distress from violent media (Study 2), lower estimates of the number of calories in unhealthy food (Study 3), and weaker reports of emotional attachments to family members and hometowns (Study 4)."
Social Psychology,Flag priming,* **Flag priming. **Participants primed by a flag are more likely to be more in conservative positions than those in the control condition.
Social Psychology,Fluency priming,"* **Fluency priming. **Objects that are fluent (e.g., conceptually fluent, visually fluent) are perceived more concretely than objects that are disfluent (disfluent objects are perceived more abstractly)."
Social Psychology,Money priming,"Images or phrases related to money cause increased faith in capitalism, and the belief that victims deserve their fate."
Social Psychology,Commitment priming (recall),Participants exposed to a high-commitment prime would exhibit greater forgiveness.
Social Psychology,Mortality Salience,"* **Mortality Salience** (Death Priming/Terror Management Theory). Reminders of death lead to subconscious changes in attitudes and behaviour, for example in the form of increased in-group bias and behaviour that serves to defend an individual’s cultural worldview."
Social Psychology,Spatial priming for emotional closeness,Plotting points closer together led to participants reporting they were closer to their own family members than those who plotted points farther apart.
Social Psychology,Implicit God prime increases self-reported risky behaviour,Implicitly priming God using the scrambled-sentence paradigm increases self-reported risk taking.
Social Psychology,Implicit God prime increases actual risky behaviour,Implicitly priming God using the scrambled-sentence paradigm increases willingness to engage in risky behaviour for financial reward.
Social Psychology,Implicit religious priming,Implicitly priming god concepts by unscrambling sentences with words relating to religion increases prosocial behaviour in an anonymous economic game.
Social Psychology,Heat priming,Exposure to words related to hot temperatures increases aggressive thoughts and hostile perceptions. This effect suggests that people mentally associate heat-related constructs with aggression-related constructs.
Social Psychology,Honesty priming,"* **​​Honesty priming** (goal-priming, social priming). An increased level of honesty to embarrassing behaviours after exposure to honesty-related words."
Social Psychology,Achievement priming,"* **Achievement priming **(goal priming, high-performance goal priming). Exposing individuals to words that are success oriented (e.g., win, strive) will increase their performance on a task compared to those exposed to neutral words (e.g., carpet, shampoo).​"
Social Psychology,Weapons priming effect,"* **Weapons priming effect **(weapons effect). Stimuli or cues associated with aggression, such as weapons, can elicit aggressive responses."
Social Psychology,Goal priming effect,"* **Goal priming effect** (goal contagion, goal inspiration, behavioural inspiration). The observation of other’ behaviour (e.g., your observe someone jogging in the park) may lead to the inference of the goal in the observer (“This person wants to keep fit.”) and to the adoption of the same goal (“Maybe I should do some sports too.”)."
Social Psychology,Olfactory priming of cleaning behaviour,"* **Olfactory priming of cleaning behaviour** (scent priming, sensory priming). People who were exposed to a lemon scent were more likely to engage in a range of cleaning-related behaviours and have more rapid access to cleaning-related concepts, compared to people who were not exposed to a lemon-scent. This finding suggests that olfactory cues can be processed unconsciously and impact people’s cognition and downstream behaviour."
Social Psychology,Verbal framing (temporal tense),Participants who read what a person **was doing** (relative to those who read what person **did**) showed enhanced accessibility of intention-related concepts and attributed more intentionality to the person.
Social Psychology,Reference framing,"* **Reference framing. **Risk preferences change depending on whether a choice is presented in terms of gains or losses, even when the prospects of the options are held constant.​"
Social Psychology,Prosocial spending,Spending money on other people leads to greater happiness than spending money on oneself.
Social Psychology,Gustatory disgust on moral judgement,Gustatory disgust triggers a heightened sense of moral wrongness.
Social Psychology,Macbeth effect,Moral aspersions induce literal physical hygiene.

Social Psychology,Social class on prosocial behaviour,"Individuals from a high social class are more likely to exhibit prosocial behaviour than those from a low social class, but there is a U-shaped curve between social class and prosocial behaviour that sometimes appears."
Social Psychology,Stanford Prison Experiment,"* **Stanford Prison Experiment** employed a simulation of a prison environment to  examine the psychological effects of coercive situations. Utilising role-playing, labelling and social expectations it showed that one third of participants in the role of prison guards displayed aggressive and dehumanising behaviour."
Social Psychology,Milgram experiment,"* **Milgram experiment **was a study examining the influence of authority on immoral behaviour. Participants were assigned the role of ‘teachers’ and they were instructed by the experimentator to administer electric shocks** **of** **15-450 V voltage, whenever the ‘learner’  made a mistake. There were various variants of the study. In the most basic one, 100% of participants agree to administer a 300 V shock and 65% agreed to apply to maximum shock of 450 V."
Social Psychology,Robbers Cave Study,"Utilised arbitrary groupings to demonstrate that tribalism between groups arises spontaneously, and depending on the context, it can result in group competition (e.g., in case of scarce resources) or group cooperation (e.g., in case of superordinate goals and common obstacles)**. **"
Social Psychology,Digital technology use and adolescent wellbeing,* **Digital technology use and adolescent wellbeing. **Adolescents who spend more time on new media (including social media and electronic devices such as smartphones) are more likely to report mental health issues.
Social Psychology,Anthropomorphism,"* **Anthropomorphism. **Individuals who are lonely are more likely than people who are not lonely to attribute humanlike traits (e.g., free will) to nonhuman agents (e.g., an alarm clock),to fulfil unmet needs for belongingness."
Social Psychology,Female-named hurricanes are more deadly than male-named ones,"Original effect size was a 176% increase in deaths, driven entirely by four outliers; reanalysis using a greatly expanded historical dataset found a nonsignificant decrease in deaths from female named storms."
Social Psychology,Implicit bias testing for racism,"Implicit bias scores poorly predict actual bias, _r_ = 0.15. The operationalisations used to measure that predictive power are often unrelated to actual discrimination (e.g. ambiguous brain activations). Test-retest reliability of 0.44 for race, which is usually classed as “unacceptable”. This isn’t news; the original study also found very low test-criterion correlations."
Social Psychology,Pygmalion effect,"* **Pygmalion effect** (Rosenthal Effect, self-fulfilling prophecy). Expectations about performance (e.g., academic achievement) impact performance. Specifically, teachers' expectations about their students’ abilities affect those students’ academic achievement; teacher beliefs impact their behaviour which in turn impacts student beliefs and behaviour."
Social Psychology,Stereotype threat on Asian women’s mathematical performance,"* **Stereotype threat on Asian women’s mathematical performance** (stereotype lift), i.e. the interaction between race, gender and stereotyping. This study found that Asian-American women performed better on a maths test when their ethnic identity was activated, but worse when their gender identity was activated, compared with a control group who had neither identity activated."
Social Psychology,Stereotype threat on girls’ mathematical performance,"* **Stereotype threat on girls’ mathematical performance. **A situational phenomenon whereby priming a negative gender stereotype (e.g., “women are bad at maths”) has a detrimental impact on mathematical performance."
Social Psychology,Increase in narcissism,"* **Increase in narcissism** (leadership, vanity, entitlement) in young people over the last thirty years. It's [an ancient hypothesis.](https://quoteinvestigator.com/2010/05/01/misbehave) The basic counterargument is that they’re misidentifying an age effect as a cohort effect (The narcissism construct [apparently](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/1745691609357019) decreases by about a standard deviation between adolescence and retirement.) “every generation is Generation Me”."
Social Psychology,Minimal group effect (MGE),"* **Minimal group effect** **(MGE)** (Minimal group paradigm). An intergroup bias that manifests as ingroup favouritism (i.e., a tendency to prefer ingroup members) when participants are assigned to previously unfamiliar, experimentally created and largely meaningless social identities. In essence, the paradigm investigates the impact of social categorization on intergroup relations in the absence of realistic conflicts of interests, showing that mere social categorization is sufficient to produce ingroup favouritism."
Social Psychology,Solomon Asch’s conformity,* **Solomon Asch’s conformity study. **The degree to which a person's own opinions are influenced by those of a group.
Social Psychology,Dynamic norms,Information about increasing minority norms increases interest/engagement in minority behaviour.​
Social Psychology,Social comparison,No robust evidence for an interaction effect between body dissatisfaction and social comparison on fat talk.
Social Psychology,Bystander effect,* **Bystander effect:** claims that the feeling of responsibility diffuses with an increasing number of other observers. Research about the bystander effect was sparked by the 1964 murder of Catherine “Kitty” Genovese. See this _[New York Times article](https://www.nytimes.com/1964/03/27/archives/37-who-saw-murder-didnt-call-the-police-apathy-at-stabbing-of.html)_ for details. Here’s a more detailed [resource](http://bps.stanford.edu/?page_id=3671).

Social Psychology,Positive mood-boost helping effect,People are more likely to do good when feeling good.
Social Psychology,Superiority-of-unconscious decision-making effect,"* **Superiority-of-unconscious decision-making effect** (deliberation without attention effect). While conscious reflection produces better choices on simple tasks, complex choices “should be left to unconscious thought”.​"
Social Psychology,Behavioural-consequences-of-automatic-evaluation,"* **Behavioural-consequences-of automatic-evaluation **(affective compatibility effect).** **Automatic classification of stimuli as either good or bad have direct behavioural consequences.​ Automatic evaluation results directly in behavioural predispositions toward the stimulus, such that positive evaluations produce immediate approach tendencies, and negative evaluations produce immediate avoidance tendencies."
Social Psychology,Self-control relies on glucose effect,"* **Self-control relies on glucose effect. **Acts of self-control decrease blood glucose levels; low levels of blood glucose predict poor performance on self-control tasks; initial acts of self-control impair performance on subsequent self-control tasks, but consuming a glucose drink eliminates these impairments.   ** **"
Social Psychology,Physical warmth promotes interpersonal warmth,"Exposure to physical warmth will lead to more positive judgments of strangers and an increase in prosocial behaviour (e.g., gift-giving)."
Social Psychology,Power impairs perspective-taking effect,* **Power impairs perspective-taking effect. **Individuals made to feel high in power were more likely to inaccurately assume that others view the social world from the same perspective as they do.
Social Psychology,Status-legitimacy effect,"Members of low-status, disadvantaged, and marginalised groups are more likely to perceive their social systems as legitimate than their high-status and advantaged counterparts under certain circumstances. People who are most disadvantaged by the status quo, due to the greatest psychological need to reduce ideological dissonance, are most likely to support, defend, and justify existing social systems, authorities, and outcomes.​"
Social Psychology,Red impairs cognitive performance effect,"* **Red impairs cognitive performance**. The colour red impairs performance on achievement tasks, as red is associated with the danger of failure and evokes avoidance motivation."
Social Psychology,Reduced prosociality of high SES effect,Higher socioeconomic status predicts decreased prosocial behaviour. Affluence may be linked with reduced empathy and poverty may be linked with increased empathy.
Social Psychology,Moral licensing effect,"* **Moral licensing effect (**self-licensing, moral self-licensing, licensing effect) is the effect that acting in a moral way makes people more likely to excuse and perform subsequent immoral, unethical, or otherwise problematic behaviours."

Social Psychology,Playboy effect,* **Playboy Effect.** Men exposed to erotic images of the opposite-sex will report lower ratings of love for their partner and lower ratings for their partners sexual attractiveness compared to men exposed to abstract art. This effect was not found in women in either the original or replication attempts.
Social Psychology,Self-protective subjective temporal distance effect,"* **Self-protective subjective temporal distance effect. **Participants reported that negative events in their own lives felt farther away than positive events in their own lives, and this effect was stronger for participants higher in self-esteem."
Social Psychology,Trait loneliness hot shower effect,"People self-regulate their feelings of social warmth (connectedness to others) through applications of physical warmth of shower or bath, without explicit awareness of this substitution. Loneliness as a form of “social coldness” can be relieved by applying physical warmth."
Social Psychology,American flag priming boosts Republican support,"* **American flag priming boosts Republican support. **Subtle exposure to the American flag causes people to report more conservative, Republican beliefs and attitudes."
Social Psychology,Unethicality darkens perception of light,"* **Unethicality darkens perception of light **(El Greco fallacy). Recalling abstract concepts such as evil (as exemplified by unethical deeds) and goodness (as exemplified by ethical deeds) can influence the sensory experience of the brightness of light. Recalling unethical behaviour led participants to see the room as darker and to desire more light-emitting products (e.g., a flashlight) compared to recalling ethical behaviour."
Social Psychology,Fertility on voting,"* **Fertility on voting **(Ovulation effect). Ovulatory (or high-fertility) phase of the menstrual cycle affects voting preferences and has different effects on women who are single then women who are in committed relationships. Single women were more likely to vote for Barack Obama (liberal/Democrat candidate) if they were ovulating then if they were not, while the opposite was true for women in committed relationship – ovulation led them more likely to vote for Mitt Romney (conservative/Republican candidate).​"
Social Psychology,Modulation of 1/f noise on the weapon identification task,Making an effort to modulate the use of racial information decreases the emission of 1/f noise.
Social Psychology,Time is money effect,Putting a price on time can influence enjoyment of leisure activities as individuals get more impatient if they are compensated for engaging in these activities. ​
Social Psychology,Embodiment of secrets,"* **Embodiment of secrets** (secrets-as-burdens). Secrets are experienced as physical burdens, influencing how people perceive and act in the world.​ People who recalled, were preoccupied with, or suppressed an important secret estimated hills to be steeper and perceived distances to be farther."
Social Psychology,Warmer-hearts-warmer-room effect,* **Warmer-hearts-warmer-room effect. **Priming “warm” communal traits (vs. other traits) led participants to report that the room in which they were taking the study was warmer.
Social Psychology,Treating-prejudice-with-imagery effect,Imagining a positive encounter with a member of a stigmatised group promote positive perceptions when it was preceded by imagined negative encounter.​
Social Psychology,Grammar influences perceived intentionality effect,* **Grammar influences perceived intentionality**. Describing a person's behaviours in terms of what the person _was doing _(rather than what the person _did_) enhances intentionality attributions in the context of both mundane and criminal behaviors.​ Participants judged actions described in the imperfective as being more intentional and they imagined these actions in more detail.
Social Psychology,Attachment-warmth embodiment effect,* **Attachment-warmth embodiment effect** (anxious attachment warm food effect) Attachment anxiety positively predicts sensitivity to temperature cues.​ Individuals with high (but not low) attachment anxiety report higher desires for warm foods (but not neutral foods) when attachment is activated.
Social Psychology,Superstition boosts performance effect,"The irrational belief that certain objects (e.g., lucky charms) or beliefs (e.g., religion) will benefit performance in a task.​"
Social Psychology,Social and personal power,"Social power (power over other people) and personal power (freedom from other people) have opposite associations with independence and interdependence; they have opposite effects on stereotyping (social power decreases and personal power increases stereotyping), but parallel effects on behavioural approach (both types of power increase it)."
Social Psychology,Classical anchoring effect,* **Classical anchoring effect** (anchoring and adjustment). Assimilation of numeric estimates toward previously considered numeric values. ​
Social Psychology,Incidental environmental anchoring effect,"* **Incidental Environmental Anchoring** (incidental anchoring [[Critcher & Gilovich, 2008]](https://doi.org/10.1002/bdm.586), basic anchoring [[Wilson, Houston, Etling, & Brekke, 1996]](https://doi.org/10.1037//0096-3445.125.4.387) “Anchor values that are incidentally present in the environment can affect a person’s numerical estimates (...) these effects were not qualified by participants’ expertise in the relevant domain (study 1) or by their ability to subsequently recall the anchor value (study 3).” (Critcher & Gilovich, 2008)."
Social Psychology,Subliminal anchoring effect,"* **Subliminal anchoring effect** (subliminal anchoring). Numeric estimates are biassed toward previously, subliminally presented numbers that could not be perceived by respondents.​"

Social Psychology,Sex differences in implicit maths attitudes,"College students, especially women, demonstrated negativity toward maths and science relative to arts and language on implicit measures.​"
Social Psychology,Low versus high category scale effect on behaviour self – report,"* **Low versus high category scale effect on behaviour self-report**. Response scales serve informative functions. The response categories suggest a range of ""usual"" or ""expected"" behaviours, and this information affects respondents' behavioural reports as well as related judgments."
Social Psychology,Information source on attitudes effect,The source of information has a major impact on how that information is perceived and evaluated.
Social Psychology,Door-in-the-face effect,* **Door-in-the-face effect.** The door-in-the-face effect occurs when making a larger initial request and then afterwards scaling back and asking a more moderate request increases compliance (with the moderate request) compared to either starting with the moderate request or starting with a small request.
Social Psychology,Foot-in-the-door effect,* **Foot-in-the-door effect. **The foot-in-the-door effect occurs when getting people to comply with a very small initial request increases the likelihood that they will agree to a larger request (compared to starting with the larger request).
Social Psychology,Ingroup-outgroup norm of reciprocity effect,"“When confronted with a decision about allowing or denying the same behaviour to an ingroup and outgroup, people may feel an obligation to reciprocity, or consistency in their evaluation of the behaviours.”"
Social Psychology,Social dominance-status,"* **Social dominance-status **(verticality effects). Vertical dimension of human relations (such as dominance and submission) and nonverbal behaviour are intimately and fruitfully linked; nonverbal behaviour, such as gazing, smiling, touching, and various body positions can signal high and low verticality."
Social Psychology,Personal cognitive dissonance - free-choice paradigm,"Personal cognitive dissonance, from the cognitive dissonance theory (Festinger, 1957), suggests that an inconsistency between two cognitions (e.g., an attitude and a past behaviour) creates an unpleasant psychological state (i.e., personal dissonance) that the individual is motivated to reduce (e.g., by changing one of the elements to fit the other). This personal cognitive dissonance has been studied in the literature through different paradigms, including the following three main ones: free-choice, induced-compliance and induced-hypocrisy paradigm. The mere act of choosing equally desirable options can arouse dissonance in the individual, because choosing option A implies the rejection of option B (in other words, choosing option A means accepting its advantages but also its disadvantages, but also accepting to deprive oneself of the advantages of option B). In order to reduce dissonance, subjects will increase the perceived gap between options (i.e., spreading of alternatives) by overestimating the chosen option and/or underestimating the rejected option. ​"
Social Psychology,Personal cognitive dissonance - induced-compliance paradigm,"In this paradigm, subjects are led to perform, in a context of free choice, an inconsistent act with their own norms or social norms (e.g., agree to perform a counter-attitudinal act). Dissonance can be resolved through multiple modes of reduction (e.g., social support, trivialization, etc.), but attitude change remains the most studied mode of reduction.​"
Social Psychology,Personal cognitive dissonance - induced-hypocrisy paradigm,"* **Personal cognitive dissonance - Induced-hypocrisy paradigm**. In this paradigm, dissonance is aroused by making individuals aware of the discrepancy between a socially desirable behaviour (e.g., not wasting water; stage 1: normative commitment phase) and their own past transgressive behaviours (e.g., remembering one's past water waste; stage 2: transgression salience phase). Most of the dissonance reduction work is done through behavioural means, and leads subjects to express behavioural intentions, and/or perform behaviours in the direction of the socially desirable behaviours expressed in step 1 (i.e., allowing for the reduction of the inconsistency between the norm, step 1, and the recall of transgressions, step 2).​"
Social Psychology,Vicarious cognitive dissonance - induced-compliance paradigm,"Vicarious cognitive dissonance, from the cognitive dissonance theory (Festinger, 1957; see “personal cognitive dissonance”), suggests that it would be possible for an individual to experience dissonance vicariously when they witness the performance of inconsistent act (e.g., counter-attitudinal or counter-normative behaviour) on the part of an in-group member with whom they strongly identify. As a personal cognitive dissonance, the inconsistency between two cognitions (e.g., between attitude and observed behaviour) creates an unpleasant psychological state (i.e., vicarious dissonance) that the individual is motivated to reduce (e.g., by changing one of the elements to fit the other). This vicarious cognitive dissonance has been studied in the literature through different paradigms, including the following two main ones: induced-compliance and induced-hypocrisy paradigm. In this paradigm, subjects are led to observe the realisation, by a member of their in-group, of a counter-attitudinal act with their own norms or social norms (e.g., agree to perform a counter-attitudinal act), performed in a context of free choice. Dissonance can be resolved through multiple modes of reduction (e.g., social support, trivialization, ect.), but attitude change remains the most studied mode of reduction.​"
Social Psychology,Vicarious cognitive dissonance - induced hypocrisy paradigm,"* **Vicarious cognitive dissonance - Induced-hypocrisy paradigm**. In this paradigm, subjects are made to observe a member of their group becoming aware of the discrepancy between a socially desirable behaviour (e.g., not wasting water; stage 1: normative commitment phase) and their own past transgressive behaviours (e.g., remembering one's past water waste; stage 2: transgression salience phase). Most of the dissonance reduction work is done through behavioural means, and leads subjects to express behavioural intentions, and/or perform behaviours in the direction of the socially desirable behaviours expressed in step 1 (i.e., allowing for the reduction of the inconsistency between the norm, step 1, and the recall of transgressions, step 2).​"
Social Psychology,Impostor phenomenon,"* **Imposter phenomenon**. People who perform outstandingly both academically and professionally believe that in fact, they are not really bright and that they have fooled anyone who thinks otherwise. This phenomenon might be especially persistent in women. Key conclusion: Therapeutic interventions might help to overcome imposter syndrome."
Social Psychology,Ability Emotional Intelligence as a Second Stratum Factor of Intelligence,"* **Ability EI as a factor of intelligence. **Ability EI is a collection of cognitive abilities relating to the recognition, understanding and management of emotions. There have been many controversies in attempting to contextualise Ability EI within models of intelligence/cognitive ability. MacCann et al. (2014) empirically tested multiple models of how various cognitive abilities interact, including hierarchical and bi-factor models, and the data demonstrated closest fit to a hierarchical structure where Ability EI was contextualised as a second-stratum factor. A recent replication repeated this modelling process and drew the same conclusion."
Social Psychology,Matilda effect,* **Matilda effect **(Matthew Matilda effect)**.** Male scientists and masculine topics are frequently perceived as demonstrating higher scientific quality.
Social Psychology,Being slightly behind increases chance of winning,* **Being slightly behind increases the chance of winning.** The original study has found that being slightly behind at halftime increases the chance of winning significantly in professional Basketball.​
Social Psychology,Ethnoracial diversity and trust,* **Ethnoracial diversity and trust.** Ethnoracial diversity negatively affects trust and social capital.
Social Psychology,Greed moderates relationship between SES and unethical behaviour,"* **Greed moderates the relationship between SES and unethical behaviour.** The original study found that people of higher socio-economic status are more likely to engage in unethical behaviour, but that this relationship is moderated by greed. When study participants were primed to think positively about greed, those of lower SES became more likely to engage in unethical behaviour than those of higher SES."
Social Psychology,Women’s education increasing domestic violence,* **Women’s education increases domestic violence.** Women with more education report higher levels of psychological violence at home​.
Social Psychology,Easterlin paradox,"* **Easterlin paradox.** (national income associated with happiness). When comparing across countries, higher levels of income are associated with higher levels of subjective well-being, yet this association does not show up across time."
Social Psychology,Humour style clusters,"* **Humour style clusters. **A number of works have attempted to determine whether individuals can be categorised into different types of humour user. The first was by Galloway (2010) and suggested four types of humour user through use of cluster analysis: (1) above average on all of the styles, or (2) below average on all of the styles, or (3) above average on the positive styles (Affiliative and Self-enhancing), and below average on the negative styles (Aggressive and Self-defeating), or (4) above average on the negative styles and below average on the positive styles."
Social Psychology,Social referencing effect,"* **Social referencing effect:** Crosby et al. (2008) found that hearing an offensive remark caused subjects to look longer at a potentially offended person, but only if that person could hear the remark. On the basis of this result, they argued that people use social referencing to assess the offensiveness."
Social Psychology,Other-race effect,"* **Other-race effect** (cross-race effect, own-race bias). Humans are better at distinguishing between faces of two individuals of their own race than two faces of another race."
Social Psychology,Unethical amnesia,* **Unethical amnesia. **Memories of unethical behaviour are less clear and vivid than memories of good deeds.​​
Social Psychology,Feeling dirty after networking,"People feel uncomfortable networking because networking triggers a state of “moral impurity,” which translates into feelings of “dirtiness” and a heightened desire for “cleansing”."
Social Psychology,Public exposure influences shame/guilt differently,* **Public exposure influences shame and guilt differently. **Public exposure (implicit and explicit) of transgression increases experienced shame more than guilt.
Social Psychology,Drunk utilitarian,People are more likely to accept harm for the greater good when they are under the influence of alcohol.

Social Psychology,Grit and Well-being,"Grittier people, those pursuing long-term goals with perseverance and passion, have greater subjective well-being."
Social Psychology,Verbal overshadowing effect,"* **Verbal overshadowing effect. **In a series of six experiments, verbalising the appearance of previously seen visual stimuli impaired subsequent recognition performance."
Social Psychology,Age of acquisition effects - influence on free recall (pure block),* **Age of acquisition effects - influence on free recall (pure block).  **Early-acquired items are recalled more accurately than late-acquired items when early-acquired items are presented in a separate block and late-acquired items are presented in a separate block.

Social Psychology,Age of acquisition influence on the pre-conceptual stages of lexical retrieval (progressive demasking),"* **Age of acquisition influences the pre-conceptual stages of lexical retrieval (progressive demasking). **Early-acquired items are identified more accurately than late-acquired items, using a progressive demasking task. A progressive demasking task is a type of perceptual identification task where participants are presented with a series of words that are gradually revealed over time and their ability to identify words at each stage of the task is measured. Words learned at an earlier age are thought to be easier to demask than those learned later in life, perhaps because the individual has gained more experience and exposure to the word, which can make it easier to recognize."
Social Psychology,Age of acquisition influence on the pre-conceptual stages of lexical retrieval (object decision),* **Age of acquisition influence on the pre-conceptual stages of lexical retrieval (object decision). **The age at which one acquires the concept of  an object does not contribute to the speed and accuracy of recognising whether an object is a real object or not a real world object that has chimeric features.
Social Psychology,Age of acquisition influence on the pre-conceptual stages of lexical retrieval (anagram solution),"* **Age of acquisition influence on the pre-conceptual stages of lexical retrieval (anagram solution). **Age of acquisition is thought to affect lexical retrieval through its impact on anagram (word jumbles) solutions, such that words acquired at an earlier age tend to be solved more quickly and accurately in anagram tasks than those learned later in life. This may be because words learned earlier in life are more deeply encoded and may therefore be more easily accessed."
Social Psychology,Age of acquisition influence on the pre-conceptual stages of lexical retrieval (visual duration threshold),"* **Age of acquisition influence on the pre-conceptual stages of lexical retrieval (visual duration threshold). **Early-acquired items are identified more accurately than late-acquired items, using visual duration threshold task."
Social Psychology,Age of acquisition influence on the pre-conceptual stages of lexical retrieval (category verification),"* **Age of acquisition influence on the pre-conceptual stages of lexical retrieval (category verification). **The age at which one acquires an object does not contribute to the speed and accuracy of category verification during a semantic categorisation task (where objects have to be decided whether they represent one group or another, e.g. tools vs. furniture)."

Social Psychology,Mental simulation - bigger is better effect,* **Mental simulation - bigger is better effect.** Items that are big in real size are processed more quickly than items that are small in real size. ​
Social Psychology,Transposed word effect,* **Transposed word effect.** Responses to transposed word sequences (e.g. “you that read wrong”) are more error-prone and judged as ungrammatical compared with a control sequence (e.g. “you that read worry”).
Social Psychology,Personality > intelligence predicting life outcomes,"Personality is generally more predictive than IQ on a variety of important life outcomes, such as educational attainment and wage."
Social Psychology,Error salience effects,* **Error salience **(epistemic contextualism effects). Judgments about “knowledge” are sensitive to the salience of error possibilities. This is explained by the fact that salience shifts the evidential standard required to truthfully say someone “knows” something when those possibilities are made salient.​
Social Psychology,Gettier intuition effect,Participants attributed knowledge in Gettier-type cases (where an individual is justified in believing something to be true but their belief was only correct due to luck) at rates similar to cases of justified true belief.

Social Psychology,Heterogeneity reduces perceived quantity,"Sets of multiple colourful or different objects (e.g., stars, squares, triangles) seem less with respect to their quantity than the same sets that consist of only one type of object (e.g., only red triangles)."
Social Psychology,Eye movement and false memories,* **Eye movements and false memories. **Lateral eye movements increase false memory rates.
Social Psychology,Gaze-liking effect,"People are more likely to rate objects as more likeable when they have seen a person repeatedly gaze toward, as opposed to away from the object."

Social Psychology,Phonological awareness impairment in dyslexic adults,Dyslexic show lower scores on phonological awareness than neurotypical adults.
Social Psychology,Phonemic fluency impairment in dyslexic adults,"Dyslexic adults show lower scores on phonemic fluency tasks than neurotypical adults. Phonemic fluency tasks are a type of verbal fluency task, where people are asked to generate as many words as possible according to a specific criterion relating to phonemes, for instance words starting with the letter ‘M’."
Social Psychology,Semantic fluency impairment in dyslexic adults,"Dyslexic adults show lower scores on semantic fluency than neurotypical adults. Semantic fluency tasks are a type of verbal fluency task, where people are asked to generate as many words as possible according to a specific criterion, for instance items that are part of the same category, such as foods."
Social Psychology,Lexical precision on lexical competition,* **Lexical precision lexical competition. **The direction and magnitude of inhibitory priming in word targets with dense neighbourhoods is moderated by spelling.
Social Psychology,Placebo effect,"* **Placebo Effect. **Refers to the phenomenon in which a treatment or intervention that has no specific therapeutic effect (such as a sugar pill or saline injection) can still produce a therapeutic response in some individuals. The concept of the placebo effect can be traced back to the 18th century, when physicians and researchers began to notice that patients often reported improvements in their symptoms after receiving treatments that did not have any known physiological effects."
Social Psychology,Placebo empathy analgesia,Downregulating first-hand pain perception via placebo analgesia (administration of an inert treatment such as a sugar pill)​ also dampens empathy for another person in pain.
Social Psychology,Nocebo effect,* **Nocebo effect. **This phenomenon is said to occur when negative expectations of an individual about an experience (e.g. a medical treatment) cause the experience to have a more negative effect than it would have otherwise.
Social Psychology,Stroop effect,"* **Stroop Effect. **A phenomenon in which it takes longer to name the ink colour of a word when the word itself is a colour name that is different from the ink colour (e.g. the word ""red"" printed in blue ink). The Stroop effect is considered a classic demonstration of the interference between different types of information processing."
Social Psychology,Disfluency effect,"Disfluency, the subjective experience of difficulty associated with cognitive operations, leads to deeper cognitive processing. If information is processed with difficulty or disfluently (e.g. when written in hard-to-read fonts), this experience serve as a cue that the task is difficult or that one’s intuitive (System 1) response is likely to be wrong, thereby activating more elaborate (System 2) processing, resulting in more positive cognitive outcomes.​"
Social Psychology,Retrieval-induced forgetting,* **Retrieval-induced forgetting **(RIF). Forgetting of some items is in part a consequence of remembering other items.
Social Psychology,Mood-dependent retrieval,"* **Mood-dependent retrieval **(mood-dependent memory, state dependent memory, encoding specificity). Memory is enhanced when an individual’s mood (i.e., emotional state) at retrieval matches their mood at encoding."
Social Psychology,Positive emotions broaden scope of attention,People experiencing positive emotions exhibit broader scopes of attention than do people experiencing no particular emotion.
Social Psychology,Emotional information facilitates response inhibition,"Response inhibition refers to suppression of prepotent responses which are inappropriate to current task demands. In the lab setting, this is investigated with a stop signal task. The effect showed that both fearful and happy faces as stop signals facilitated response inhibition relative to neutral ones."
Social Psychology,Inhibition-induced devaluation,"* **Inhibition induced devaluation.** Inhibition-induced devaluation refers to reduced response to stimuli which were previously inhibited. This effect results in participants bidding less for shapes that were paired with stop-signals, giving less trustworthiness rating for faces previously paired with stop signals. This effect has several implications for behaviour modification techniques."
Social Psychology,Inhibition induced forgetting,* **Inhibition induced forgetting.** Inhibition-induced forgetting refers to impaired memory for the stimuli to which responses were inhibited.
Social Psychology,Semantic Richness Effects in Lexical-Semantic Processing: Body-object Interaction Effect,"* **Body-object interaction (BOI) effect in lexical-semantic processing.** Words that have higher ratings on the BOI measure receive faster responses (RTs) in lexical-semantic tasks (e.g., lexical decision, semantic decision). The BOI quantifies the ease with which the human body can physically interact with a word’s referent. The BOI effect is thought to show that sensorimotor information contributes to word meaning, providing support for embodied theories of semantic representation."
Social Psychology,False memory implantation,"* **False memory implantation (false memory fabrication). **People fabricate false memories after the suggestion that it happened. After discussing their memories with a researcher, participants reported a false memory."
Social Psychology,Serial dependence,"Serial dependence describes a visual bias that a reported item (e.g., orientation) is systematically attracted towards the previous reported item."
Social Psychology,Modality-switching cost,"* **Modality-switching cost** (modality switch effect). When verifying object properties, processing is slowed when the modality being processed is different from the modality processed in the preceding trial. The presence of the switching cost suggests that people represent semantic information in a modality-specific, rather than amodal or abstract, manner.​"
Social Psychology,Tactile Disadvantage,"* **Tactile Disadvantage **(conceptual tactile disadvantage). Participants find it more difficult and are slower to process words strongly related to the tactile modality (e.g., _sticky_), compared to processing words from other modalities (visual, auditory etc.). The presence of this conceptual tactile disadvantage mirrors a similar disadvantage observed in perceptual processing, where tactile stimuli are slower and more difficult to process than visual or auditory stimuli.​"
Social Psychology,Perceptual strength in lexical processing,* **Perceptual strength in lexical processing **(visual lexical decision task). Concepts that are rated as being more strongly linked to perceptual experience are processed more quickly than those more weakly linked to perceptual experience. This pattern suggests a sensory basis for conceptual representations.​
Social Psychology,Semantic richness in lexical processing,"* **Semantic richness in lexical processing **(visual lexical decision task). Concepts that are associated with a larger amount of semantic information (e.g., larger number of features, greater semantic neighbourhood density) are processed more quickly in tasks that require semantic processing. This pattern suggests that richer semantic representations (i.e., more semantic information) facilitate semantic processing."
Social Psychology,Temporal doppler effect,Subjective perception that the past is further away than the future.
Social Psychology,Contextual cueing,"Compared to novel contexts (i.e., spatial arrangements), repeated contexts yield faster response times in visual search without consciously recognizing the context as repeated."
Social Psychology,Search initiation effect,"In a repeated search task, the very first search takes substantially longer than all subsequent searches, implying that most information is processed and learned during the first search which can then be used to guide subsequent searches efficiently.​"
Social Psychology,Attentional blink,"The attentional blink describes the phenomenon that in a rapid serial visual presentation ​of items, humans show a reduced ability to detect the second of two targets among distractors if the second target follows after approximately 200ms – 500ms after the first target. This effect is interpreted as displaying one of the limitations of human visual processing."
Social Psychology,Emotional attentional blink,"* **Emotional attentional blink** (emotion-induced blindness). Similar to the attentional blink, a target among distractors in a rapid serial visual presentation of images is missed, if it was preceded by an emotionally arousing image. Importantly and in contrast to the attentional blink phenomenon, the emotionally ​arousing image is task-irrelevant."
Social Psychology,Growth mindset,* **Growth mindset.** Thinking that skill is improvable on attainment.
Social Psychology,"Expertise attained after 10,000 hours practice","The notion that it takes around 10,000 hours of practice to become an expert in a particular field or domain. Specifically, that deliberate practice explains from most to all of the variance in (expert) performance in sports."
Social Psychology,Tailoring to learning styles,* **Tailoring to learning styles.** Tailoring teaching to students’ preferred learning styles has any effect on objective measures of attainment.
Social Psychology,Neonate imitation,Babies are born with the ability to imitate.
Social Psychology,Violent media content on aggression,"Violence content in media can affect people to be more aggressive. Notably, the studies of this effect differ by media (TV, games, etc.) and whether long, medium, or short-term effects have been investigated. The variety of methods/tests further complicates the literature. Distinct media types are marked for each reference below."
Social Psychology,Mutual exclusivity bias,"When presented with two objects, one of which has a known label and one which does not, infants (by ~20mo) are more likely to choose the object without a known label when prompted with a novel label."
Social Psychology,Mutual exclusivity bias - bilinguals,* **Mutual exclusivity bias in bilinguals**. Bilingual (and multilingual) infants exhibit delayed and/or lower mutual exclusivity bias than monolingual infants.

Social Psychology,Graphology,The analysis of handwriting with the attempt to determine someone’s personality traits.
Social Psychology,Default effect,"* **Default effect. **In a choice scenario between two alternatives, when an alternative is presented as a default option, people stick with it rather than change it. For example, 'Opt Out' default organ donation policies increase organ donations."
Social Psychology,Decoy effect,"* **Decoy effect **(alternatives: asymmetric dominance; attraction effect). The Decoy Effect is a cognitive bias in which an individual's preference between two options is influenced by the presence of a third, asymmetrically dominated  option (i.e., a decoy similar but inferior to one of the original options). Individuals are more likely to choose the option that is similar to the decoy option than if the decoy were absent. Decoy effect has been replicated in different studies and contexts, though the magnitude of the effect can vary, particularly depending on the specific features of the options being considered and the context in which the decisions are being made."
Social Psychology,Nudges,* **Nudges.** Choice architecture interventions that promote beneficial decisions.
Social Psychology,Risky choice framing effect,"* **Risky choice framing effect **(term used by Levin et al., 1998) (framing effect in risky-decision making). Under loss-frame, people are risk-seeking, whereas under gain-frame, people are risk-averse. In framing studies, logically equivalent choice situations are differently described and the resulting preferences are studied. In risky choice problems, the way a choice is presented influences the decision (e.g. saving 10 people out of 100 vs losing 90 people out of 100)."
Social Psychology,Risk and goal message framing,"* **Risk and goal message framing.** a) For illness detection behaviours, loss framing (presenting information of negative consequences with undesirable behaviours / without desirable behaviours) would be more effective than gain framing (presenting information of benefits through engaging in desirable behaviours) in encouraging healthy attitudes, intentions, and behaviours (perhaps because illness detection behaviours are riskier, Rothman and Salovey, 1997), whereas b) for health-affirming behaviours, gain framing would be more effective than loss framing in motivating healthy attitudes, intentions, behaviours (perhaps because health-affirming behaviours are less risky, Rothman and Salovey, 1997)."
Social Psychology,Status quo effect,"* **Status quo effect **(status quo bias). A cognitive bias that leads people to prefer things to stay the same, even when change may be beneficial, thus a preference for the current state of affairs"
Social Psychology,Temporal action-inaction effect,"* **Temporal action-inaction effect.** The proposed phenomenon that people associate or experience stronger regret with action compared to inaction in the short-term, but stronger regret with inaction compared to action in the long-term. ​"
Social Psychology,Money market versus goods/social market,"* **Money market versus goods/social market. **The money market relationship refers to an exchange in which effort level is determined based on the level of compensation. By contrast, the social market relationship is an exchange in which effort level is most influenced by altruistic motivations rather than the compensation level. Heyman and Ariely (2004) proposed and showed that when the former is primed with monetary compensation, the more compensation they receive, the more effort they displayed. Yet, effort level did not vary depending on the level of compensation when the latter is primed with non-monetary compensation (i.e., goods), effort level does not depend on compensation level. ​"
Social Psychology,Risk benefits negative association,* **Risk and benefit perceptions **(affect heuristic). Increasing risks of a hazard leads people to judge its benefits as lower while vice versa increasing benefits leads people to judge its risk as lower.​
Social Psychology,Temporal value asymmetry,* **Temporal value asymmetry** (TVA). The phenomenon that contemplating future events elicits stronger emotions than contemplating past events has been coined “temporal value asymmetry” (TVA).  TVA was robust in between-persons comparisons and absent in within-persons comparisons.
Social Psychology,Exceptionality effect,"* **Exceptionality effect.** (emotional amplification, normality bias, exceptional-routine effect). The affective response to an event is enhanced if its causes are abnormal. Exceptionality effect is the phenomenon that people associate stronger negative affect with a negative outcome when it is a result of an exception (abnormal behaviour) compared to when it is a result of routine (normal behaviour). The exceptionality enhances the response to an event for the emotion of regret, self-blame, the cognitive response for victim compensation and offender punishment."
Social Psychology,Temporal differences in trait self-ascriptions,"Much like how we are more likely to ascribe dispositional traits, as opposed to situational variables, when explaining the behaviour of other people compared to ourselves, the same asymmetry can also be observed when making trait assessments about our temporally distant selves (e.g. past or future). People are more likely to ascribe dispositional traits, compared to situational explanations, when making judgements about their past or future self."
Social Psychology,Bias Blind Spot,The phenomenon that people perceive stronger biases for others compared to self. Pronin (2002) found support for self-other asymmetries in perceived biases but failed to find support for self-other asymmetries in perceived personal shortcomings. Chandrashekar et al. (2021) found support for self-other asymmetries for both biases and personal shortcomings.​
Social Psychology,Hindsight Bias,Hindsight bias refers to the tendency to perceive an event outcome as more probable after being informed of that outcome.
Social Psychology,Disjunction Effect,"The sure-thing principle (STP) posits that if decision-makers are willing to make the same decision regardless of whether an external event happens or not, then decision-makers should also be willing to make the same decision when the outcome of the event is uncertain. People regularly violate the STP – uncertainty about an outcome influence decisions.​"
Social Psychology,Money Illusion,"* **Money Illusion. **The inability of individuals to account for inflation or deflation when making decisions. If inflation, money loses value over time, leading to people to fail to consider the impact of inflation or real value of money."
Social Psychology,Choosing versus rejecting,"* **Choosing versus rejecting** (Framing effects, compatibility principle). People are inconsistent in their preferences when faced with choosing versus rejecting decision-making scenarios."
Social Psychology,Conjunction bias,"* **Conjunction bias** (conjunction fallacy). The fallacy consists of judging the conjunction of two events as more likely than any of the two specific events, violating one of the most fundamental tenets of probability theory."
Social Psychology,Direct versus indirect harm,"Individuals believe that causing indirect harm is more moral than direct harm, regardless of outcomes, intentions, or self-presentational concern."
Social Psychology,Distinction bias,"* **Distinction bias.** When evaluating how happy options would make them, people who evaluated the options simultaneously predicted greater happiness for the good options and lower happiness for the bad options, whereas people who evaluated the options separately (i.e., only evaluated one option) showed little difference between the options."
Social Psychology,Inaction inertia effect,"Forgoing an offer that is less appealing, but still desirable, than a previous offer. For example, if you missed the opportunity to attend a skiing trip that was offered at £40 rather than the usual £100​, you would reject the offer of going to the same ski trip when offered for £80 rather than the usual £100."
Social Psychology,Mere ownership effect,The mere ownership effect refers to an individual's tendency to evaluate an object more favourably merely because he or she owns it.
Social Psychology,Omission Bias,"* **Omission Bias** (alternative terms: action-inaction effect). The tendency to view harmful actions as worse than inactions, despite the result being the same."
Social Psychology,Identifiable victim effect,"* **Identifiable victim effect.** Refers to the phenomenon that people are more likely to offer greater help to specific, identifiable victims than to anonymous victims."
Social Psychology,Psychophysical numbing,"* **Psychophysical numbing. **People prefer to save lives if they are a higher proportion of the total (e.g. do people prefer to save 4,500 lives out of 11,000 or 4,500 lives out of 250,000?)."
Social Psychology,Signing at the top and dishonesty,"* **Signing at the top and dishonesty. **Signing a veracity statement at the top, instead of at the end, of a form/document encourages honest reporting."
Social Psychology,Loss aversion,"* **Loss aversion.** The subjective value of losses exceeds the subjective values of gains. This phenomenon can denote a stronger preference for avoiding losses rather than acquiring gains. Loss aversion is still mostly replicable but with weaker effects for some people and in some situations (see [Mrkva et al., 2020](https://www.alexandria.unisg.ch/260559/2/jcpy.1156.pdf))."
Social Psychology,Effort heuristic,People judge products that took longer time to complete as higher in quality and monetary value.
Social Psychology,Unconscious thought advantage,"* **Unconscious thought advantage **(“deliberation-without-attention”). The idea that for complex choices (with more features to take into account), not deliberating leads to better decisions (as defined by the research team, i.e., normatively).​"

Social Psychology,Incidental disgust,* **Incidental disgust** (Amplification hypothesis). Irrelevant feelings of disgust can amplify the severity of moral condemnation.
Social Psychology,Single exposure musical conditioning,"* **Single-exposure musical conditioning**. An important study, which employed classical conditioning theory, proposed that a person's preference for a product can be influenced by the type of music they hear while being exposed to it. A follow-up experiment differentiated between scenarios to see whether classical conditioning or information processing might be a better explanation for product preference."
Social Psychology,Rational expectations,* **Rational Expectations. **The extent to which participants in an experiment choose the action with the highest expected payoff based on their private signal and the choices and outcomes of previous participants.
Social Psychology,Decreased sense of free will reduces personal responsibility,"* **Decreased sense of free will reduces personal responsibility. **Vohs and Schooler (2008) asked participants to read an article either debunking free will or a control passage, and found that those reading the former cheated more on an experimental task. It was suggested that the decreased sense of free will as a result of reading the text reduced perceptions of personal responsibility."
Social Psychology,Unrealistic optimism,* **Unrealistic optimism** (Optimism bias). The tendency to overestimate the likelihood of experiencing positive outcomes and underestimating negative ones.​
Social Psychology,Miles per gallon illusion,"* **Miles per gallon illusion** (MPG illusion, kilometres per litres illusion)**. **People misperceive how much fuel and money will be saved by, because they assume fuel use increases linearly with MPG, whereas in reality, increasing by a few MPG saves much more gas at low levels of MPG (e.g., 12 to 14 MPG) compared to high levels (e.g., 30 to 32 MPG)."
Social Psychology,Certainty effect,* **Certainty effect. **The tendency to overweight the importance of an increase from 99% to 100% probability that some prospect/event will occur.
Social Psychology,Overweighting small probabilities,"People tend to overweight/overreact to changes in probability from 0 to very small probabilities. (In other words, whereas classical economic theory would suggest changing from 0% to 1% chance should have the same impact as a change from a 20% to 21% chance, people respond much more strongly to the former change.)"
Social Psychology,Positive affect increases patience,* **Positive affect increases patience. **Watching a positive affect-inducing video will increase patience in an intertemporal choice task.
Social Psychology,"Slow to anger, fast to forgive","* **Slow to anger, fast to forgive.** Adding noise/uncertainty to the reason for a person’s action leads people to be more lenient (slow to anger, quick to forgive). A secondary finding is that under these circumstances with noise/uncertainty, cooperative strategies also lead to higher payoffs (in situations with cooperative equilibria)."
Social Psychology,Isolation effect,"* **Isolation effect **(Von Restorff effect). The isolation effect occurs when people focus on differences between options rather than similarities. We not only remember the differences between two stimuli, but we also tend to give it greater weighting. For example, we notice the one single yellow that stands out in a batch of red apples."
Social Psychology,Magnitude effect,"* **Magnitude effect** (magnitude perception). People are sensitive to relative as well as absolute magnitude. Most people find the difference between $100 and $200 more meaningful than the difference between $1,100 and $1,200; the marginal value of the outcome generally scales with magnitude.​"
Social Psychology,Reflection effect,"People tend to be risk seeking when maximising gains, but risk averse when minimising losses.​ The preference between negative prospects is the mirror image of the preference between positive prospects – the reflection of prospects around 0 reveres the preference order."
Social Psychology,Unusual disease problem,"* **Unusual disease problem** (Asian disease problem). When survival is communicated (positive framing), people tend to choose an option with a certain outcome (risk averse decision). In contrast, when mortality is communicated (negative framing), people tend to choose an option with an uncertain outcome (risk-seeking decision).​"
Social Psychology,Last-place aversion,* **Last place aversion.** A phenomenon where individuals are averse to being in last place and choose gambles with the potential to move them out of last place that they reject when randomly placed in other parts of the distribution.
Social Psychology,Ikea effect,"When compared to objectively similar goods not produced by themselves, consumers place a higher value on goods they have assembled. Consumers show a higher willingness-to-pay when they assemble products themselves."
Social Psychology,Endowment effect,People are more likely to retain an object they own than acquire that same object when they do not own it. This implies that the value that an individual assigns to objects appears to increase substantially as soon as that individual is given the object.
Social Psychology,Weaker sunk costs effect for time (vs. money),"* **Sunk costs effect for time (vs. money)**. Sunk costs are where an individual’s decision making is affected by having previously committed resources that cannot be recovered (e.g., time, money, effort) to a particular choice, which then results in them being less inclined to change to an alternative choice. It has been observed that there are greater sunk costs associated with previously allocated money over previously allocated time."
Social Psychology,Choice overload,The idea that giving people too many choices can lead to certain undesirable consequences such as reduced purchasing intentions.
Social Psychology,Mate guarding,"* **Mate guarding**, Women use conspicuous luxurious goods to deter female rivals by signalling to other women they have a devoted partner."
Social Psychology,Scarcity effect - Overborrowing,* **Scarcity effect - _Overborrowing_. **Perceived financial scarcity causes consumers to overborrow.
Social Psychology,Scarcity effect - Resource allocation,* **Scarcity effect - _Resource allocation_. **Poor economic conditions favour resource allocations to daughters over sons.
Social Psychology,Scarcity effect - Planning,"* **Scarcity effect - _Planning_.** Consumers who feel resource constrained shift to engage in relatively more priority planning, rather than efficiency planning."
Social Psychology,Scarcity effect - Competition/threat,* **Scarcity effect - _Competition/threat_.** Exposure to limited-quantity promotion advertising prompts consumers to perceive other shoppers as competitive threats.
Social Psychology,Scarcity effect - Brand attitudes,* **Scarcity effect - _Brand attitudes_**. Observing luxury brand consumers whose consumption arises from unearned financial resources reduces observers’ brand attitudes when observers place a high value on fairness.​
Social Psychology,Scarcity effect - Product use creativity,* **Scarcity effect - _Product use creativity_**. Scarcity salience is associated with greater creativity.​
Social Psychology,Scarcity effect - Wage rates,* **Scarcity effect - _Wage rates_**. The difference in implied wage rates based on a time elicitation versus a money elicitation procedure is reduced as the time horizon increases.​
Social Psychology,Scarcity effect - Selfishness,* **Scarcity effect - _Selfishness_. ** Reminders of scarcity causes selfish behaviour to a greater extent in people with low social value orientation.​
Social Psychology,Scarcity effect - Preference for material goods,* **Scarcity effect - _Preference for material goods_.** Scarcity leads to a preference for material goods over experiential goods.​
Social Psychology,Scarcity effect - Preference polarisation,* **Scarcity effect - _Preference polarisation_**. Perceived scarcity leads to greater preference polarisation and stronger preference for a preferred option over a less preferred option.​
Social Psychology,Product size and status,People who are low in power choose supersized foods and drinks to signal status.
Social Psychology,Less-is-better effect,"* **Less-is-better effect. **People are willing to pay more money for a product that contains lower quantity when it looks more full, such as an overfilled ice cream cup with 7 oz rather than underfilled larger ice cream cup with 8 oz."
Social Psychology,Left digit bias,"* **Left digit bias. **The leftmost digit of a number disproportionately influences decision making. Consumers judge the difference between $4.00 and $2.99 to be larger than that between $4.01 and $3.00, even though the numeric differences are identical; it is this change in the left digit, rather than the one cent drop, that affects the magnitude perception."
Social Psychology,Sensory marketing – Brand name sounds,"* **Sensory marketing – Brand name sounds** (Sound symbolism). The sound of a brand name can communicate information about the product, e.g. its size, speed, strength, weight, etc. Hypothetical brand names including front (vs. back) vowels are associated with smallness, fastness, softness, bitterness, friendliness, and prettiness. Hypothetical brand names including back (vs. front) vowels are associated with dark color, mildness, richness, warmness, masculine, strong, and heaviness."
Social Psychology,Sensory marketing – Phonetic symbolism on brand name preference,"Particular words are preferred as brand names when the phonetic connotations of the words are consistent with the product attributes. Front vowel sounds were preferred over back vowel sounds for convertible and knife; in contrast, back vowel sounds were preferred over front vowel sounds for 4 × 4 vehicle and hammer."
Social Psychology,Sensory marketing – Color saturation and perceived product size,"The perceived size of products depends on the saturation of their color. Increasing color saturation increases size perceptions; high (vs. low) saturation increases product size estimates, attention, and arousal."
Social Psychology,"Sensory marketing – Healthy-left, unhealthy-right","*  **Sensory marketing – Healthy-left, unhealthy-right**. Displaying healthy items to the left (vs. right) of unhealthy items enhances preference for the healthy options.​ Participants tend to prefer the healthy item (broccoli salad) when it is on the left (vs. right) of the images."
Social Psychology,Sensory marketing – Brand names and evaluation of products,"* **Sensory marketing – Brand names and evaluation of products. **Phonetic structure of brand names affects a consumer’s evaluation of products and their underlying attributes.​ Brand names including back (vs. front) vowels are rated as higher in the attribute perception index (richness, smoothness, and creaminess). The diagnostic information (true name, test name) and the timing of the information provided (simultaneously, afterward) modulate the effects of brand names on the attribute perception."
Social Psychology,Sensory marketing – Visual depiction effect,"Visual product depictions within advertisements, such as the manipulation of orienting a product toward a participant’s dominant hand, facilitate purchase intention."
Social Psychology,Sensory marketing – Circular and angular logo shapes,"Circular and angular-logo shapes influence consumers’ judgement of softness-related and hardness-related product attributes. The circular logo leads to more favourable perceptions of comfortableness (the softness-related attribute), whereas the angular logo leads to more favourable perceptions of durability (the hardness-related attribute)."
Social Psychology,"Sensory marketing – Past-left, future-right effect","When consumers view advertisements in which product images are positioned congruently (incongruently) with their spatial representation of time, they have more (less) favourable attitudes toward the product.​ When participants are primed to desire a modern product, they are more favourable when it appears on the right side of the advertisement; in contrast, when participants are primed to desire an antique, they are more favourable when the product appears on the left."
Social Psychology,Sensory marketing – Logo dynamism,"Static visuals can evoke a perception of movement (i.e., dynamic imagery) and thereby affect consumer engagement and attitudes. The evoked dynamic imagery affects the level of consumer engagement with the brand logo. A logo that evokes greater perceived movement (logo dynamism) generates more favorable attitudes toward the brand."
Social Psychology,Sensory marketing – More is merrier,"The number of product units displayed on a package biases consumers' perceptions of product quantity (i.e., the number of snack items the package contains) and actual consumption. Packages with more product units displayed on the package are perceived to contain more product quantity than packages with fewer product units displayed on the package."
Social Psychology,“Brain drain” effect,"* **“Brain drain”** **effect**. The mere presence of one’s own smartphone may occupy limited-capacity cognitive resources, thereby leaving fewer resources available for other tasks and undercutting cognitive performance.​ The mere presence of these devices reduces available cognitive capacity."
Social Psychology,Goal conflict and work and leisure time spent,People who are faced with a goal conflict are (1) more likely to spend time on work and (2) less likely to spend time on leisure. This is because goal conflict increases reliance on salient justifications and work tends to be easier to justify and leisure harder to justify.
Social Psychology,Ad-type_ _effect,"* **Ad-type effect**. In advertising a desired change, progression ads (which include intermediate steps in addition to starting and ending points) foster spontaneous simulation of the process through which the change will happen, which makes these ads more credible and, in turn, more persuasive than before/after ads (include visuals of the starting and ending point of the promised change).​"
Social Psychology,One mind per hemisphere,"* **One mind per hemisphere **(split-brain syndrome). Surgical severing of the corpus callosum leads to the split-brain phenomenon, which is characterised by 1) a response × visual field interaction, 2) strong hemispheric specialisation 3) confabulations after left-hand actions 4) split attention, and 5) the inability to compare stimuli across the midline. Together, these reported effects have been interpreted as evidence for split consciousness. Surgical procedure does not result in the development of two independent minds or consciousnesses within one brain. Instead, the findings suggest that the two hemispheres continue to work together, even in the absence of the corpus callosum."
Social Psychology,Hydrocephaly,"* **Hydrocephaly.** The effect of massive volume loss improving cognition. Hydrocephalus, also known as ""water on the brain,"" is a condition in which there is an abnormal accumulation of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) in the ventricular system of the brain. This can cause the ventricles to become enlarged, putting pressure on the brain and causing a wide range of symptoms, depending on the severity of the condition and the age of the individual. There are two types of Hydrocephalus: congenital and acquired. Congenital Hydrocephalus is present at birth and is caused by a genetic or developmental abnormality. Acquired Hydrocephalus develops later in life and can be caused by a variety of factors, such as a brain tumour, infection, or injury."
Social Psychology,Readiness potentials,"* **Readiness potentials. **Readiness potentials are neural signals that are observed in the brain prior to voluntary movements. They are typically measured using electroencephalography (EEG) and are thought to reflect the neural activity associated with preparing for a movement, occurring several hundred milliseconds before the movement occurred, suggesting that the brain prepares for the movement before the person is consciously aware of the decision to move. RP have been observed in various regions of the brain, including the primary motor cortex, supplementary motor area, and premotor cortex. [Schurger](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8192467/) et al. (2021) for a glossary. The discovery of readiness potentials (RP) has been used to argue against the concept of free will, as it suggests that the neural activity associated with a voluntary movement starts before the person is consciously aware of the decision to move."
Social Psychology,Left-Brain vs. Right-Brain Hypothesis,"* **Left-brain vs. Right-brain Hypothesis. **Individuals may be left-brain dominant or right-brain dominant based on personality and cognitive style. Specifically, the hypothesis proposes that the two hemispheres of the brain have different functions and abilities, with the left hemisphere being associated with logical, analytical, and verbal skills, and the right hemisphere being associated with creative, intuitive, and spatial skills. This idea has been popularised in popular culture, but it is not supported by scientific evidence."

Social Psychology,Precarious manhood,"Manhood, in contrast to womanhood, is seen as a precarious state requiring continual social proof and validation.​ Compared with womanhood, which is typically viewed as resulting from a natural, permanent, and biological developmental transition, manhood must be earned and maintained through publicly verifiable actions; because of this, men experience more anxiety over their gender status than women do, particularly when gender status is uncertain or challenged."
Social Psychology,Trivers–Willard hypothesis,"The Trivers–Willard hypothesis predicts that parents in good condition will be biassed towards investing more in their sons, while parents in poor condition will invest more in their daughters; this investment involves both post-birth investment and manipulation of the sex ratio. As female reproductive success is less variable than male one, daughters are a safer bet for providing at least some progeny, but very successful sons can have many more children than daughters."
Social Psychology,Birth order effect on sexuality,"* **Fraternal birth order effect on male homosexuality ** (older brother effect). Male homosexuals are more likely than male heterosexuals to have one or more older brothers. Biologically, that is thought to be due to the immunisation of the mother against Y-linked proteins during previous pregnancies with male foetuses, which decreases the activity of those proteins responsible for heterosexual male sexual orientation in subsequently-born sons."

Social Psychology,Owners predict spatial impulsivity in dogs,"* **Owners predict spatial impulsivity in dogs** (spatial discounting, spatial discount, distance discounting). This phenomenon explores whether owner ratings of impulsivity in their dogs correlate with behavioural measures of the distance their dogs travel in a spatial impulsivity task. The original study (Brady et al., 2018) found that owner ratings of adult dog impulsivity (using the Dog Impulsivity Assessment Scale; Wright et al., 2011) matched levels of impulsivity in a spatial impulsivity task (but not for young dogs). Two subsequent studies using similar methods did not replicate this correlation, and an overall meta-analysis did not find evidence for an effect.​"
Social Psychology,Numerical ratio effects on quantity discrimination in elephants,"* **Numerical ratio effects on quantity discrimination in elephants **(Number discrimination, quantity/number judgments). The numerical ratio between quantities has been shown to predict the ability to discriminate quantities across a wide range of species. However, Irie-Sugimoto et al., (2009) found that elephants did not follow this pattern because numerical ratio did not predict performance. Perdue et al. (2012) replicated the study in elephants with a similar design and found that ratio predicted performance, reversing the findings of the original study.​"
Social Psychology,Contagious yawning in dogs,"Dogs have been shown to yawn more after observing a person yawn than after a control condition with other mouth movements. The original study (Joly-Mascheroni et al., 2008) found 72% of dogs yawned after watching a human yawn but none yawned after watching other mouth movements. Two subsequent studies did not replicate a difference in yawning between conditions (Harr et al., 2009; O’Hara and Reeve, 2010), but a third did find a difference (Madsen and Persson, 2012)."
Social Psychology,Temporal preferences in chimpanzees and bonobos,"* **Temporal preferences in chimpanzees and bonobos** (temporal/time discounting, intertemporal choice, delay choice). Chimpanzees (_Pan troglodytes_) wait longer than bonobos (_Pan paniscus_) in intertemporal choice tasks providing choices between smaller, sooner and larger, later food rewards. Rosati et al.

Social Psychology,Risk preferences in chimpanzees and bonobos,* **Risk preferences in chimpanzees and bonobos** (risky choice). Chimpanzees (_Pan troglodytes_) choose risky options more than bonobos (_Pan paniscus_) in risky choice tasks providing choices between guaranteed and risky food rewards. Heilbronner et al. (2008) found chimpanzees preferred risky options more than bonobos at the Leipzig Zoo. Rosati and Hare (2013) confirmed this finding in a group of chimpanzees and bonobos at Tchimpounga Chimpanzee Sanctuary in Republic of Congo.
Social Psychology,Typological Prevalence Hypothesis: Learnability of semantics (evidentiality),"* **Typological Prevalence Hypothesis.** The typological prevalence hypothesis is a proposal that suggests that certain structural features are more common across languages than others due to factors such as ease of learning, processing, and use. These more prevalent structural features are thought to be more likely to be retained in a language over time. Claims that  cross-linguistically more prevalent distinctions are easier to learn, or the more common a certain distinction or way of categorising across languages, the more cognitively natural (and easily learnable) for humans it should be. This effect is explored for the grammatical structure of evidentiality, or grammatical marking of information source in an utterance."
Social Psychology,Stuttering and bilingualism,Bilingual children had an increased risk of stuttering and a lower chance of recovery from stuttering than language exclusive and monolingual speakers.
Social Psychology,Stuttering and self-esteem,"* **Stuttering and self-esteem.** Children who stutter have higher self-esteem than children who do not stutter. However, the self-esteem of children who stutter declines once they reach adolescence."
Social Psychology,Stuttering and dyslexia co-occurrence,* **Stuttering and dyslexia co-occurrence. **People who stutter show high co-occurrence with dyslexia than neurotypical adults.
Social Psychology,Stuttering and phonological working memory impairment,"Adults who stutter show lower scores on phonological working memory, using a nonword repetition task."
Social Psychology,Stuttering and phonological monitoring impairment,* **Stuttering and phonological monitoring impairment.** Adults who stutter show lower scores on phonological monitoring than neurotypical adults.
Social Psychology,Stuttering and phonological awareness impairment (vs. neurotypicals),Adults who stutter show lower scores on phonological awareness than neurotypical adults.
Social Psychology,Stuttering and phonological awareness impairment (vs. dyslexia),Adults who stutter show similar scores on phonological awareness to dyslexic adults.
Social Psychology,Stuttering and reading fluency impairment (vs. dyslexia),Adults who stutter show similar scores on reading fluency to dyslexic adults.
Social Psychology,Struggling readers and stuttering co-occurrence,* **Struggling readers and stuttering co-occurrence. ** Dyslexic adults show higher co-occurrence with stuttering than neurotypical adults. ​
Social Psychology,Fake barn cases,* **Fake barn cases.** “Older participants are less likely than younger participants to attribute knowledge in fake-barn cases”.
Social Psychology,Stakes effect,"* **Stakes effect** (alternative terms = a subset of interest-relative invariantism, interest-relativity of knowledge, bank cases). Knowledge is sensitive to stakes. According to the [Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy](https://plato.stanford.edu/ENTRIES/experimental-philosophy/#Epis), ""a number of early findings from the experimental epistemology literature suggested that people's ordinary knowledge attributions actually don't depend on stakes."""
Social Psychology,Fear conditioning - Anxiety,"* **Fear conditioning - effect of trait anxiety/neuroticism on conditioning**. High trait anxiety/neuroticism leads to better fear conditioning. Evidence is mixed; some papers even find the reversed effect, depending on experimental paradigm (in particular, single-cue conditioning versus differential conditioning).​"
Social Psychology,Fear conditioning - Extraversion,* **Fear conditioning - effect of trait extraversion on conditioning**. Low trait extraversion leads to better fear conditioning.
Social Psychology,Effects of personality and education on health behaviour,* **Effects of personality and education on health behaviour** (effect of personality on the education gradient). Personality moderates the relationship between education and health behaviours.
