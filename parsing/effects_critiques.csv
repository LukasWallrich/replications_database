Social Psychology,Olfactory priming of cleaning behaviour,"scent priming, sensory priming). People who were exposed to a lemon scent were more likely to engage in a range of cleaning-related behaviours and have more rapid access to cleaning-related concepts, compared to people who were not exposed to a lemon-scent. This finding suggests that olfactory cues can be processed unconsciously and impact people’s cognition and downstream behaviour",De Lange et al.: _d_ =1.02.

Social Psychology,Stanford Prison Experiment,"employed a simulation of a prison environment to  examine the psychological effects of coercive situations. Utilising role-playing, labelling and social expectations it showed that one third of participants in the role of prison guards displayed aggressive and dehumanising behaviour","N/A. First, the study has been criticised for the lack of adherence to the experimental methodology. Although the study has been widely described as an ‘experiment’ it lacks many defining features: 1) it does not define the precise set of manipulated variables, 2) it manipulates multiple variables at time without the proper control over the effects of each one, 3) it does not define the dependent variable and how it will be measured, 4) it does not state any clear hypotheses. It is noteworthy that in the original paper, authors present their work as a “demonstration” not an experiment. Second group of serious issues is the degree of researchers’ ad-hoc interventions that were influencing the behaviour of the participants. One of the leading researchers, Philip F. Zimbardo took part in the experimental procedure as the prisons’ “Superintendent”. Another close collaborator of the research team David Jaffe, who initially conceived the idea of the mock-prison study, was playing the role of the “Warden”. Considering that these people knew the goal of the study and were, as later admitted,  interested in the particular outcome (a call for reform of the prison system), the ad-hoc intervention, such as encouraging some of the guards to be more strict and ‘tough’, cast a reasonable doubt on the role of experimentator' expectations on the final results of the study. The third group of issues is sampling. Namely, the study has been conducted on a small (n=24, n per condition = 12) and largely unrepresentative sample (all males, all college students of similar age, all residents of the United States). Also, despite the screening procedures of the voluntarily applying candidates, it is still possible that a strong ‘demand characteristic’ and ‘self-selection bias’ may have affected the composition of the sample. All the participants have responded to the newspaper ad about wanting help in  “psychological study of prison life”. The last issue with the Stanford Prison Experiment is the interpretation of the results. Even if the discovered effect is trustworthy (and above mentioned issues put this into questions), there is no clear theoretical interpretation of what this finding actually proves. Some critics argue that violent behaviour of the guards may be rooted in their following of a strong leadership, rather than from their immersion into attributed social role."
Social Psychology,Milgram experiment,"was a study examining the influence of authority on immoral behaviour. Participants were assigned the role of ‘teachers’ and they were instructed by the experimentator to administer electric shocks** **of** **15-450 V voltage, whenever the ‘learner’  made a mistake. There were various variants of the study. In the most basic one, 100% of participants agree to administer a 300 V shock and 65% agreed to apply to maximum shock of 450 V","Various sources (Burger, Perry, Branningan, Griggs, Caspar): Experiment included many** **researcher degrees of freedom, going off-script, implausible agreement between very different treatments, and “only half of the people who undertook the experiment fully believed it was real and of those, 66% disobeyed the experimenter.”. Doliński et al.: comparable effects to Milgram. Burger: similar levels of compliance to Milgram, but the level didn't scale with the strength of the experimenter prods. Blass: average compliance of 63%, but suffer from the usual publication bias and tiny samples. (Selection was by a student of Milgram.)

Various sources (Billig, Perry, Tavris): No good evidence that tribalism arises spontaneously following arbitrary groupings and scarcity, within weeks, and leads to inter-group violence. The “spontaneous” conflict among children at Robbers Cave was orchestrated by experimenters; tiny sample (maybe 70?); an exploratory study taken as inferential; no control group; there were really three experimental groups - that is, the experimenters had full power to set expectations and endorse deviance; results from their two other studies, with negative results, were not reported.

In reality, this is the fraction of respondents who yielded to the majority in at least one of the twelve trials. The reversal of this value (rarely mentioned in the literature) would be 24% - a fraction of completely independent respondents or 95% - a fraction of respondents who remain independent in at least one of twelve trials.

Social Psychology,Personal cognitive dissonance - free-choice paradigm,"Personal cognitive dissonance, from the cognitive dissonance theory (Festinger, 1957), suggests that an inconsistency between two cognitions (e.g., an attitude and a past behaviour) creates an unpleasant psychological state (i.e., personal dissonance) that the individual is motivated to reduce (e.g., by changing one of the elements to fit the other). This personal cognitive dissonance has been studied in the literature through different paradigms, including the following three main ones: free-choice, induced-compliance and induced-hypocrisy paradigm. The mere act of choosing equally desirable options can arouse dissonance in the individual, because choosing option A implies the rejection of option B (in other words, choosing option A means accepting its advantages but also its disadvantages, but also accepting to deprive oneself of the advantages of option B). In order to reduce dissonance, subjects will increase the perceived gap between options (i.e., spreading of alternatives) by overestimating the chosen option and/or underestimating the rejected option. ​","Enisman et al: Effect of free-choice paradigm on spreading of alternatives: _d _= 0.40 [0.32, 0.49]​.​ ​"
Social Psychology,Personal cognitive dissonance - induced-compliance paradigm,"In this paradigm, subjects are led to perform, in a context of free choice, an inconsistent act with their own norms or social norms (e.g., agree to perform a counter-attitudinal act). Dissonance can be resolved through multiple modes of reduction (e.g., social support, trivialization, etc.), but attitude change remains the most studied mode of reduction.​","Kenworthy et al.: Effect of induced-compliance on dissonance effects: _d _= 0.81 [0.70, 0.91]​.​ Kim et al.: Effect of induced-compliance on attitude change: _r _= .22 [.21, .24]​.​"
Social Psychology,Personal cognitive dissonance - induced-hypocrisy paradigm,"Personal cognitive dissonance - Induced-hypocrisy paradigm**. In this paradigm, dissonance is aroused by making individuals aware of the discrepancy between a socially desirable behaviour (e.g., not wasting water; stage 1: normative commitment phase) and their own past transgressive behaviours (e.g., remembering one's past water waste; stage 2: transgression salience phase). Most of the dissonance reduction work is done through behavioural means, and leads subjects to express behavioural intentions, and/or perform behaviours in the direction of the socially desirable behaviours expressed in step 1 (i.e., allowing for the reduction of the inconsistency between the norm, step 1, and the recall of transgressions, step 2).​","Priolo et al.: Effect of induced-hypocrisy on behavioural intention: _r _= .35 [.22, .46]​; Effect of induced-hypocrisy on behaviour: _r _= .30 [.10, .48]​.​"
Social Psychology,Vicarious cognitive dissonance - induced-compliance paradigm,"Vicarious cognitive dissonance, from the cognitive dissonance theory (Festinger, 1957; see “personal cognitive dissonance”), suggests that it would be possible for an individual to experience dissonance vicariously when they witness the performance of inconsistent act (e.g., counter-attitudinal or counter-normative behaviour) on the part of an in-group member with whom they strongly identify. As a personal cognitive dissonance, the inconsistency between two cognitions (e.g., between attitude and observed behaviour) creates an unpleasant psychological state (i.e., vicarious dissonance) that the individual is motivated to reduce (e.g., by changing one of the elements to fit the other). This vicarious cognitive dissonance has been studied in the literature through different paradigms, including the following two main ones: induced-compliance and induced-hypocrisy paradigm. In this paradigm, subjects are led to observe the realisation, by a member of their in-group, of a counter-attitudinal act with their own norms or social norms (e.g., agree to perform a counter-attitudinal act), performed in a context of free choice. Dissonance can be resolved through multiple modes of reduction (e.g., social support, trivialization, ect.), but attitude change remains the most studied mode of reduction.​","Jaubert: Effect of vicarious dissonance on attitude change: _η2p _= 0.07. Jaubert et al.: Effect of vicarious dissonance toward the induced-compliance paradigm: _d _= 0.35 [0.15, 0.54]. Global effect of vicarious dissonance: _d _= 0.41  [0.27, 0.54], lower estimated effects when correcting for publication bias (_d _= 0.22 [0.008, 0.43]).​"
Social Psychology,Vicarious cognitive dissonance - induced hypocrisy paradigm,"Vicarious cognitive dissonance - Induced-hypocrisy paradigm**. In this paradigm, subjects are made to observe a member of their group becoming aware of the discrepancy between a socially desirable behaviour (e.g., not wasting water; stage 1: normative commitment phase) and their own past transgressive behaviours (e.g., remembering one's past water waste; stage 2: transgression salience phase). Most of the dissonance reduction work is done through behavioural means, and leads subjects to express behavioural intentions, and/or perform behaviours in the direction of the socially desirable behaviours expressed in step 1 (i.e., allowing for the reduction of the inconsistency between the norm, step 1, and the recall of transgressions, step 2).​","Gaffney et al.: group membership X response to the hypocrisy interaction effect on attitudes _ηp2_ =0.142 /_d_ = 0.40 [calculated from the F statistics and converted using this conversion] (replicated).

This phenomenon might be especially persistent in women. Key conclusion: Therapeutic interventions might help to overcome imposter syndrome","Bravata et al.: NA but imposter phenomenon both present in men and women, particularly high among ethnic minority groups (original study mentioned white middle class women)."
Social Psychology,Ability Emotional Intelligence as a Second Stratum Factor of Intelligence,"Ability EI as a factor of intelligence. **Ability EI is a collection of cognitive abilities relating to the recognition, understanding and management of emotions. There have been many controversies in attempting to contextualise Ability EI within models of intelligence/cognitive ability. MacCann et al. (2014) empirically tested multiple models of how various cognitive abilities interact, including hierarchical and bi-factor models, and the data demonstrated closest fit to a hierarchical structure where Ability EI was contextualised as a second-stratum factor. A recent replication repeated this modelling process and drew the same conclusion","Evans et al.: NA, but [reproduced this modelling process with a new sample and drew the same conclusion](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30730169/)."

The result is statistically significant for the large NBA sample (95% CI: 0.007, 0.094), but not the large NCAA sample (95% CI: −0.025, 0.041). Additionally, the replication also tests the hypothesis in other leagues and sports. Out of 12 leagues, the effect is only significant in the NBA. "

Coronado-Montoya: indications of possible reporting bias; 108 (87%) of 124 published trials reported ≥1 positive outcome in the abstract, and 109 (88%) concluded that mindfulness-based therapy was effective, 1.6 times greater than the expected number of positive trials based on effect size d = 0.55 (expected number positive trials = 65.7); of 21 trial registrations, 13 (62%) remained unpublished 30 months post-trial completion. Britton: ES=NA; a number of mindfulness-related processes—including, mindful attention (observing awareness, interoception), mindfulness qualities, mindful emotion regulation (prefrontal control, decentering, exposure, acceptance), and meditation practice—show signs of non-monotonicity, boundary conditions, or negative effects under certain conditions. Hsiao et al.: the effects of Mindfulness-Based Relapse Prevention for Substance Use Disorders were small-to-medium in Study 1 (d = .08 to .48) and were much smaller in Study 2 (d =.03 to .21). Kuyken et al.: no evidence of school-based mindfulness training being superior to teaching-as-usual at 1 year; standardised mean differences (intervention minus control) were: 0.005 [-0.05 to 0.06] for risk for depression; 0.02 [-0.02 to 0.07] for social-emotional-behavioural functioning; and 0.02 [-0.03 to 0.07] for well-being. Sephton et al.: The MBSR treatment significantly reduced basal electrodermal (skin conductance level; SCL) activity (t = 3.298, p = .005) and SCL activity during meditation (t = 4.389, p = .001), consistent with reduced basal sympathetic (SNS) activation among women with fibromyalgia.

Cognitive Psychology,Placebo effect,"Placebo Effect. **Refers to the phenomenon in which a treatment or intervention that has no specific therapeutic effect (such as a sugar pill or saline injection) can still produce a therapeutic response in some individuals. The concept of the placebo effect can be traced back to the 18th century, when physicians and researchers began to notice that patients often reported improvements in their symptoms after receiving treatments that did not have any known physiological effects","Hróbjartsson: As compared with no treatment, placebo had no significant effect on binary outcomes (pooled relative risk of an unwanted outcome with placebo, 0.95 [0.88 to 1.02]; for the trials with continuous outcomes, placebo had a beneficial effect (pooled standardised mean difference in the value for an unwanted outcome between the placebo and untreated groups: MD= -0.28[-0.38, -0.19]; trials involving the treatment of pain, placebo had a beneficial effect MD = -0.27 [-0.40, -0.15]. Tang: _g_ = .298 (replicated). Yeung:placebo treatment led to improved perceived sleep onset latency (_g_ = 0.272), total sleep time (_g_ = 0.322), and global sleep quality (_g_ = 0.581). "
Cognitive Psychology,Placebo empathy analgesia,Downregulating first-hand pain perception via placebo analgesia (administration of an inert treatment such as a sugar pill)​ also dampens empathy for another person in pain,"Hartmann et al.: _ηp2_ &lt; 0.001 (unpleasantness ratings, intensity x group); Hartmann et al.: _ηp2_ = 0.002 (pre-effort unpleasantness ratings, intensity x group), _ηp2_ = 0.001 (post-effort unpleasantness ratings, intensity x group)."
Cognitive Psychology,Nocebo effect,This phenomenon is said to occur when negative expectations of an individual about an experience (e.g. a medical treatment) cause the experience to have a more negative effect than it would have otherwise,"Petersen et al.: lowest _d_ = 0.65 [0.24, 1.05], highest _d_ = 1.07 [0.65, 1.48]. Horváth et al.: nocebo effects on motor performance, mean effect size = 0.60 [mean ES calculation method was not reported]."
Cognitive Psychology,Stroop effect,"Stroop Effect. **A phenomenon in which it takes longer to name the ink colour of a word when the word itself is a colour name that is different from the ink colour (e.g. the word ""red"" printed in blue ink). The Stroop effect is considered a classic demonstration of the interference between different types of information processing","Damen: _ηp2_ = 0.541 [0.369, 0.652]. Epp et al.: Emotional Stroop task in depression (replicated): on negative stimuli, _g_=.98, and on positive stimuli, _g_=.87. Homack and Riccio: individuals with ADHD fairly consistently exhibit poorer performance as compared to normal controls on the Stroop (mean weighted effect size of 0.50 or greater). MacKenna and Sharma: doubt on the fast and non-conscious nature of emotional Stroop. "
Cognitive Psychology,Disfluency effect,"Disfluency, the subjective experience of difficulty associated with cognitive operations, leads to deeper cognitive processing. If information is processed with difficulty or disfluently (e.g. when written in hard-to-read fonts), this experience serve as a cue that the task is difficult or that one’s intuitive (System 1) response is likely to be wrong, thereby activating more elaborate (System 2) processing, resulting in more positive cognitive outcomes.​","Kühl and Eitel: no disfluency effect on cognitive and metacognitive processes and outcomes in any of the thirteen studies reviewed; effect size estimates not reported (not replicated). Meyer et al.: the effect of disfluent font on cognitive reflection test scores in 13 studies from _d _= -0.25 to _d _= 0.12 (reported, all non-significant) [not replicated].

Cognitive Psychology,Positive emotions broaden scope of attention,People experiencing positive emotions exhibit broader scopes of attention than do people experiencing no particular emotion,"Bruyneel et al.: Across three experiments, positive affect consistently failed to exert any impact on selective attention, Exp 1: _ηp2 _= 0.04, Exp 2: _ηp2 _= 0.001, Exp 3: _ηp2 _= 0.01 (null effects). Huntsinger: Rather than having fixed effects on the scope of attention, the impact of positive and negative affect is surprisingly flexible. Huntsinger et al.: Positive affect empowers whatever focus is momentarily dominant, Exp 1: _d_= 0.58, Exp 2: _d_= 0.71. "
Cognitive Psychology,Emotional information facilitates response inhibition,"Response inhibition refers to suppression of prepotent responses which are inappropriate to current task demands. In the lab setting, this is investigated with a stop signal task. The effect showed that both fearful and happy faces as stop signals facilitated response inhibition relative to neutral ones","[Pandey and Gupta: ](https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-022-19116-5)Angry faces as stop signal impaired response inhibition compared to happy faces,[ d = 0.35](https://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/document?repid=rep1&type=pdf&doi=89e9f47cbe4019e86ac43ee196e18f36a0cef6f6).

Cognitive Psychology,Inhibition-induced devaluation,"Inhibition induced devaluation.** Inhibition-induced devaluation refers to reduced response to stimuli which were previously inhibited. This effect results in participants bidding less for shapes that were paired with stop-signals, giving less trustworthiness rating for faces previously paired with stop signals. This effect has several implications for behaviour modification techniques","Wessel et al.: Exp 1: _η2_= 0.25, Exp 2: _η2_= 0.24. Chen et al.: Exp 1: nogo vs go: _d_= -0.39 [-0.71, -0.08], nogo vs untrained: _d_= -0.57 [-0.71, -0.08], Exp 2: nogo vs go: _d_= -0.91 [-1.31, -0.55], nogo vs untrained: _d_= -0.60 [-0.97, -0.27]. "
Cognitive Psychology,Inhibition induced forgetting,Inhibition-induced forgetting refers to impaired memory for the stimuli to which responses were inhibited,"Le and Cho: Showed inhibition induced forgetting when stimuli was task relevant, Exp 1: _d_= 0.06, Exp 2: _d_= 0.32, Exp 3: _d_= 0.31 (Calculated using[ this](https://lbecker.uccs.edu/) calculator)."
Cognitive Psychology,Semantic Richness Effects in Lexical-Semantic Processing: Body-object Interaction Effect,"Body-object interaction (BOI) effect in lexical-semantic processing.** Words that have higher ratings on the BOI measure receive faster responses (RTs) in lexical-semantic tasks (e.g., lexical decision, semantic decision). The BOI quantifies the ease with which the human body can physically interact with a word’s referent. The BOI effect is thought to show that sensorimotor information contributes to word meaning, providing support for embodied theories of semantic representation","Siakaluk et al.: Study 1a: _η2_ = .38, Study 1b: _η2_ = .38, Study 2: _η2_ = .57.. Tousignant and Pexman: Study 1: _η2_ = 0.69, Study 2: _η2_ = 0.25, Study 3: _η2_ = 0.16, Study 4: _d_ = 0.05 (not reported, calculated from the M and SD reported in Table 3 but does not take into account within-subject design).

Cognitive Psychology,False memory implantation,"false memory fabrication). **People fabricate false memories after the suggestion that it happened. After discussing their memories with a researcher, participants reported a false memory",Murphy et al.: 35% of participants ‘remembered’ the false memory.
Cognitive Psychology,Serial dependence,"Serial dependence describes a visual bias that a reported item (e.g., orientation) is systematically attracted towards the previous reported item","Fritsche et al.: a=1.15°[NA] – a=1.17°[NA]. Czoschke et al.: a=6.11°[5.28 – 6.94] ([calculated](https://www.calculator.net/confidence-interval-calculator.html)), a=4.11°[3.04 – 5.18] ([calculated](https://www.calculator.net/confidence-interval-calculator.html)).

"
Cognitive Psychology,Modality-switching cost,"modality switch effect). When verifying object properties, processing is slowed when the modality being processed is different from the modality processed in the preceding trial. The presence of the switching cost suggests that people represent semantic information in a modality-specific, rather than amodal or abstract, manner.​","Vermeulen et al.: _d _= 0.5, consistent with the original, with Switch trials being slower than Non-Switch trials. Lynott & Connell: _d_ =  0.36. Ambrosi et al.: _d _= 0.2 (Adults), _d _= 0.24 (Children).  "
Cognitive Psychology,Tactile Disadvantage,"conceptual tactile disadvantage). Participants find it more difficult and are slower to process words strongly related to the tactile modality (e.g., _sticky_), compared to processing words from other modalities (visual, auditory etc.). The presence of this conceptual tactile disadvantage mirrors a similar disadvantage observed in perceptual processing, where tactile stimuli are slower and more difficult to process than visual or auditory stimuli.​",NA.
Cognitive Psychology,Perceptual strength in lexical processing,visual lexical decision task). Concepts that are rated as being more strongly linked to perceptual experience are processed more quickly than those more weakly linked to perceptual experience. This pattern suggests a sensory basis for conceptual representations.​,"Brysbaert et al.: _r_=.919, correlation between two concreteness ratings: r=.898. Speed & Brybaert: Study 2a:_R2_: .628, RMSE: .629. Concrete words: _R2_: .376, RMSE: .461. Abstract words: _R2_: .245, RMSE: .390.Study 2b: _R2_: .480, RMSE: .90. High imageability: _R2_: .340, RMSE: .656, Low imageability: _R2_: .053, RMSE: .531. "
Cognitive Psychology,Semantic richness in lexical processing,"visual lexical decision task). Concepts that are associated with a larger amount of semantic information (e.g., larger number of features, greater semantic neighbourhood density) are processed more quickly in tasks that require semantic processing. This pattern suggests that richer semantic representations (i.e., more semantic information) facilitate semantic processing","Yap et al.: Adjusted _R2_: LDT: RT=.63, Accuracy=.31, Pronunciation: RT=.56, Accuracy=.07, SCT: RT=.31, Accuracy=.16; Change in _R2_: LDT: RT=.02, Accuracy=.03, Pronunciation: RT=.02, Accuracy=.00, SCT: RT=.31, Accuracy=.16; Yap et al.: Experiment 1 (clear) _d_ = 0.42, Experiment 1 (degraded) _d_ = 0.33, Experiment 2 Neighbourhood Density (Clear) _d_ = 34, Experiment 2 Neighbourhood Density (Degraded) _d_ = 0.14, Experiment 2 Semantic Diversity (Clear) _d_ = 0.35, Experiment 2 Semantic Diversity (Degraded) _d_ = 0.18.

Chua & Chun: _ηp2_=0.86.  Travis et al.: _ηp2_=0.28.
Cognitive Psychology,Search initiation effect,"In a repeated search task, the very first search takes substantially longer than all subsequent searches, implying that most information is processed and learned during the first search which can then be used to guide subsequent searches efficiently.​",NA.
Cognitive Psychology,Attentional blink,"The attentional blink describes the phenomenon that in a rapid serial visual presentation ​of items, humans show a reduced ability to detect the second of two targets among distractors if the second target follows after approximately 200ms – 500ms after the first target. This effect is interpreted as displaying one of the limitations of human visual processing",Raymond et al.: _ηp2_=0.33 ([calculated](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1_vNjPCI7H52T8tav1reYgWx6puMT03JZVY1wvEPHrWU/edit)).

Judgement and Decision Making/Behavioural Economics,Decoy effect,"alternatives: asymmetric dominance; attraction effect). The Decoy Effect is a cognitive bias in which an individual's preference between two options is influenced by the presence of a third, asymmetrically dominated  option (i.e., a decoy similar but inferior to one of the original options). Individuals are more likely to choose the option that is similar to the decoy option than if the decoy were absent. Decoy effect has been replicated in different studies and contexts, though the magnitude of the effect can vary, particularly depending on the specific features of the options being considered and the context in which the decisions are being made",Heath and Chatterjee: not reported for overall decoy effect.

Judgement and Decision Making/Behavioural Economics,Risky choice framing effect,"term used by Levin et al., 1998) (framing effect in risky-decision making). Under loss-frame, people are risk-seeking, whereas under gain-frame, people are risk-averse. In framing studies, logically equivalent choice situations are differently described and the resulting preferences are studied. In risky choice problems, the way a choice is presented influences the decision (e.g. saving 10 people out of 100 vs losing 90 people out of 100","Klein et al.: _d_=.60 [0.53, 0.67]. Kühberger: The author finds that certain characteristics of framing studies are crucial to getting a consistent framing effect, but that the closer a methodology is to the original methodology, the better chance to replicate the original effect, _d_ = .308. Steiger and Kühberger: _d_ = .522 to 0.56 (with only 81 of the 136 studies). "
Judgement and Decision Making/Behavioural Economics,Risk and goal message framing,"a) For illness detection behaviours, loss framing (presenting information of negative consequences with undesirable behaviours / without desirable behaviours) would be more effective than gain framing (presenting information of benefits through engaging in desirable behaviours) in encouraging healthy attitudes, intentions, and behaviours (perhaps because illness detection behaviours are riskier, Rothman and Salovey, 1997), whereas b) for health-affirming behaviours, gain framing would be more effective than loss framing in motivating healthy attitudes, intentions, behaviours (perhaps because health-affirming behaviours are less risky, Rothman and Salovey, 1997","Cox et al.:  _ηp2_=0.03 [0.00, 0.12], non-significant, but may be due to limited power. van Riet et al.: criticised reasoning of applying Kahneman and Tversky (1981) Prospect Theory (which was more suitable and applicable for risky choice framing) to goal message framing; they also reviewed direct empirical and meta-analytical evidence, and it appears the evidence of risk-framing hypothesis in message framing is not conclusive."

Judgement and Decision Making/Behavioural Economics,Temporal action-inaction effect,"The proposed phenomenon that people associate or experience stronger regret with action compared to inaction in the short-term, but stronger regret with inaction compared to action in the long-term. ​","Bonnefon and Zhang: The intensity of recent regrets is predicted by the consequences of the behaviour, and especially so for actions. The intensity of distant regrets is predicted by the consequences of the behaviour and by its justification, the effect of justification being stronger for actions than for inactions; failed to find support for temporal pattern.  Feldman et al.: Participants reported more inaction than action regrets, and, contrary to prior research findings, regrets produced by actions and inactions were equally intense; failed to find support for temporal pattern. Towers et al.: Although regrets of inaction were more frequent than regrets of action, regrets relating to actions were slightly more intense; failed to find support for temporal pattern.  Yeung and Feldman: Study 1: _V_ = 0.25, Study 3: _V_ = 0.15 to _V_ = 0.23, Study 4: _V_ = 0.10 to _V_ = 0.24, Study 5: _V_ = 0.04 to _V_ = 0.05. Zeelenberg et al.: found support for temporal pattern of regret with real-life experience studies; when prior outcomes were positive or absent, people attributed more regret to action than to inaction; however, following negative prior outcomes, more regret was attributed to inaction, a finding that the authors label the _inaction effect_. "
Judgement and Decision Making/Behavioural Economics,Money market versus goods/social market,"The money market relationship refers to an exchange in which effort level is determined based on the level of compensation. By contrast, the social market relationship is an exchange in which effort level is most influenced by altruistic motivations rather than the compensation level. Heyman and Ariely (2004) proposed and showed that when the former is primed with monetary compensation, the more compensation they receive, the more effort they displayed. Yet, effort level did not vary depending on the level of compensation when the latter is primed with non-monetary compensation (i.e., goods), effort level does not depend on compensation level. ​","Imada et al.: replicated the original finding that people expect others to be more willing to help when they are offered a medium amount of cash compared to a small amount of cash; contrary to Heyman and Ariely 2004, they found that people expect others to be more willing to help when they are offered with medium amount of goods compared to small amount of goods; the effect size (medium vs. small) for money was much larger than that for goods, and their replications overall supported the original claim that the sensitivity to compensation level differs depending on money vs. social market relationships; Study 1: Money market: _d_ = -1.25 [-1.43, -1.06]; Social market: _d_ = -0.43 [-0.60, -0,26]; Study 2: Money market: _d_ = -1.30 [-1.39, -1.22]; Social market: _d_ = -0.87 [-0.94, -0.79]."

Judgement and Decision Making/Behavioural Economics,Temporal value asymmetry,TVA). The phenomenon that contemplating future events elicits stronger emotions than contemplating past events has been coined “temporal value asymmetry” (TVA).  TVA was robust in between-persons comparisons and absent in within-persons comparisons,"Caruso et al. (within-subject analysis): Study 1: Monetary Valuation: _d_ = 0.03 [-0.24, 0.30]; Difficulty: _d_ = 0.01 [-0.27, 0.26]; Qualification: _d_ = 0.18 [-0.09, 0.45]; Study 4 (DV = Monetary Value): Relevance: _ηp2_ =  0.00 [0.00, 0.02]; Temporal Location: _ηp2_ =  0.00 [0.00, 0.02]; Relevance*Temporal Location: _ηp2_ =  0.00 [0.00, 0.01]; Study 4 (DV = Stress): Relevance: _ηp2_ =  0.01  [0.00, 0.04]; Temporal Location: _ηp2_ =  &lt;0.001 [0.00, 0.01]; Relevance*Temporal Location: _ηp2_ =  0.001 [0.00, 0.02]. Caruso (within-subject analysis): Study 1: Fairness: _d_ = 0.13 [-0.06, 0.32]; Negative Emotions: _d_ = 0.01 [-0-19, 0.20]; Brand’s Intentions: _d_ = -0.09 [-0.28, 0.10]. Kvam et al.: Our work provides a direct counterpoint to both the empirical phenomenon and this theoretical explanation for the temporal value asymmetry. First, we show systematic reversals of the temporal value asymmetry where participants sometimes preferred past outcomes. There were multiple instances where participants indicated that they preferred payoffs that could have occurred in the past to ones that could occur in the future in perfectly matched pairs – where the same dollar amount could be received in either the past or future at the same temporal distance (X days ago vs X days from now). Second, these reversals occurred as both the magnitude of and distance to the past / future payoffs were manipulated. Participants favoured past events when payoffs were small and temporal distance was large ($11, 2 years ago / from now), and favoured future events when payoffs were large or temporal distance was small ($10k, 7 days ago / from now). This may explain apparent replication failures related to the temporal value asymmetry (El Halabi et al., 2021) – not because the phenomenon is not real, but because different stimuli can cause it to reverse, and thus on average, fail to appear. Third and finally, a model comparison showed that framing the temporal value asymmetry in terms of hyperbolic (or even the more general hyperboloid) discounting is insufficient to account for the patterns of behaviour we observed."
Judgement and Decision Making/Behavioural Economics,Exceptionality effect,"emotional amplification, normality bias, exceptional-routine effect). The affective response to an event is enhanced if its causes are abnormal. Exceptionality effect is the phenomenon that people associate stronger negative affect with a negative outcome when it is a result of an exception (abnormal behaviour) compared to when it is a result of routine (normal behaviour). The exceptionality enhances the response to an event for the emotion of regret, self-blame, the cognitive response for victim compensation and offender punishment","Kutscher and Feldman: _d _= 1.58 to _d _= 3.12. Fillon et al.: _g _= 0.41 to _g _= 0.79; the effect of exceptionality on counterfactuals was not significant and close to zero (_k_ = 5, _g_ = 0.39 [0.08, 0.70]). They also found that the effect for between-participants design is half the size of studies with a within-subject design."
Judgement and Decision Making/Behavioural Economics,Temporal differences in trait self-ascriptions,"Much like how we are more likely to ascribe dispositional traits, as opposed to situational variables, when explaining the behaviour of other people compared to ourselves, the same asymmetry can also be observed when making trait assessments about our temporally distant selves (e.g. past or future).

Judgement and Decision Making/Behavioural Economics,Extinction bursts,"Extinction is an intervention procedure to reduce tantrum behaviours, by removing enforcement (eg. ignoring a child crying), and an extinction burst is a temporary increase in the frequency or intensity of that behavior","Arin et al.: Pigeons exhibited aggression towards nearby pigeons or models after being conditioned to peck a response key. This aggression was caused by the transition from food reinforcement to extinction. Various factors influenced the duration and frequency of attack. Katz and Lattal: Response increases relative to baseline during the first 20 min of a 324.75-min extinction session (Experiment 1) or during the first 30-min extinction session (Experiments 2 and 3) were rare and unsystematic. The results reinforce earlier meta-analyses concluding that extinction bursts may be a less ubiquitous early effect of extinction than has been suggested. Lerman and Iwata: Reported an initial increase in the frequency of the target response in 24% of the cases when extinction was implemented. Lerman et al.: Pattern of behaviour is consistent with what has been observed in studies of extinction bursts, where an initial increase in the targeted behaviour is often observed following the introduction of an extinction procedure.

Neuroscience (humans,One mind per hemisphere,"split-brain syndrome). Surgical severing of the corpus callosum leads to the split-brain phenomenon, which is characterised by 1) a response × visual field interaction, 2) strong hemispheric specialisation 3) confabulations after left-hand actions 4) split attention, and 5) the inability to compare stimuli across the midline. Together, these reported effects have been interpreted as evidence for split consciousness. Surgical procedure does not result in the development of two independent minds or consciousnesses within one brain. Instead, the findings suggest that the two hemispheres continue to work together, even in the absence of the corpus callosum","de Haan et al.: NA, body of evidence is insufficient to answer this question, different theories of consciousness have different predictions on the unity of mind in split-brain patients, and await the results of further investigation into this intriguing phenomenon.

Neuroscience (humans,Hydrocephaly,"The effect of massive volume loss improving cognition. Hydrocephalus, also known as ""water on the brain,"" is a condition in which there is an abnormal accumulation of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) in the ventricular system of the brain. This can cause the ventricles to become enlarged, putting pressure on the brain and causing a wide range of symptoms, depending on the severity of the condition and the age of the individual. There are two types of Hydrocephalus: congenital and acquired. Congenital Hydrocephalus is present at birth and is caused by a genetic or developmental abnormality. Acquired Hydrocephalus develops later in life and can be caused by a variety of factors, such as a brain tumour, infection, or injury","NA.​ Crucially, for meta-analyses on improvements after Hydrocephaly treatment see Zhang (2020) or Tabatabaee et al. (2019). Hawks: The reported cases do not apparently involve significant gray matter tissue loss. A ""thin"" cortex does not necessarily imply functionally small cortical volume, even with substantial white tissue loss. Neuroskeptic: While the enormous “holes” in these brains seem dramatic, the bulk of the grey matter of the cerebral cortex, around the outside of the brain, appears to be intact and in the correct place; no detailed post-mortem studies of their brain tissue have been published. Gwern: the cases turn out to be suspiciously un⁣ver⁣i⁣fi⁣able (Lor⁣ber), likely fraud⁣u⁣lent (Oliveira), or actually low in⁣tel⁣li⁣gence (Feuil⁣let).

Neuroscience (humans,Readiness potentials,"Readiness potentials are neural signals that are observed in the brain prior to voluntary movements. They are typically measured using electroencephalography (EEG) and are thought to reflect the neural activity associated with preparing for a movement, occurring several hundred milliseconds before the movement occurred, suggesting that the brain prepares for the movement before the person is consciously aware of the decision to move. RP have been observed in various regions of the brain, including the primary motor cortex, supplementary motor area, and premotor cortex.

Travers et al.: replicated (no ES). McGilchrist/ Alexander et al.: The neural activity observed may not necessarily be associated with the preparation for a voluntary movement, but rather with a cognitive process such as attention or decision making.

Evolutionary Psychology,Trivers–Willard hypothesis,"The Trivers–Willard hypothesis predicts that parents in good condition will be biassed towards investing more in their sons, while parents in poor condition will invest more in their daughters; this investment involves both post-birth investment and manipulation of the sex ratio. As female reproductive success is less variable than male one, daughters are a safer bet for providing at least some progeny, but very successful sons can have many more children than daughters","For sex ratios: Thouzeau et al. (the meta-analysis concluded that both post-birt parental investment and sex ratio were consistent with the Trivers–Willard hypothesis but due to heterogeneity in methodology and the fact that investment studies usually report only interaction, which makes estimating size effects very challenging, they reported size effects only for studies concerning sex ratios, reported in Fig. S3): _r_ = 0.037 [0.0055, 0.0676].

Educational Psychology,First instinct fallacy,"the false belief that one’s initial thoughts/ideas/answers are right and closer to the truth than revised thoughts/ideas/answers. Surveys have shown that students generally believe that changing answers on a multiple-choice test lowers test scores, but research seems to show that most people who change their answers usually improve their test scores","Couchman et. al.: _d_=0.58. Students who were confident in their first answers were usually right, and those who were not confident were usually wrong. They also found that changing answers from low to high confidence improved scores, and changing from high to low confidence lowered scores. They said that metacognition, or thinking about one’s own thinking, helped students decide when to change answers, and that the first instinct fallacy depended on how confident students were in their first answers. Additionally shows that  although participants were generally better at answering questions when they were confident in their first instinct, revising answers can still lead to improved performance, especially when participants are less confident in their initial response."

The reference in all analyses are white candidates. In sum, the meta analysis found no support for the hypothesis that voters discriminate against ethnic minority political candidates, and in the case of Asian candidates, even favour them over white candidates. One caveat when comparing this replication to the original is that the replication considers voters of all races, while the original specifically singles out white voters.

Political Psychology,Moral foundations across the political spectrum,"Moral Foundations Theory is a framework that claims that humans have five innate and universal moral values: Care, Fairness, Loyalty, Authority, and Purity.

Americans, and the researchers suggested incorporating more dimensions of oppression and resistance. Davis et al.: White participants: 𝛽 = 0.47, Black participants: 𝛽  = 0.19; Researchers examined the applicability of MFT to Black Americans and found that it did not replicate well in Black samples, suggesting a bias toward White American morality. The six foundations of MFT did not capture the moral concerns of Black. Harper and Rhodes: 𝛽  = 0.14-0.50. They found that only three meaningful clusters emerged in their analysis: traditionalism, compassion, and liberty. They suggested that the MFQ may not be a valid measure of MFT and that the theory may need to be revised, fail to replicate (low effect size). "

Hence, in a large-scale, cross-sectional study, performed across 26 countries (_N_ = 104,253), the authors showed that the predicted quadratic relationship between political orientation and conspiracy mentality was indeed significant. Van der Linden et al.: highlight the asymmetric relationship, reporting that  US conservatives (rather than US liberals) are more likely to endorse specific conspiracy theories, and they were also more likely to espouse conspiratorial worldviews in general (_r_ = .27 [0.24, 0.30]).

Comparative Psychology,Owners predict spatial impulsivity in dogs,"spatial discounting, spatial discount, distance discounting). This phenomenon explores whether owner ratings of impulsivity in their dogs correlate with behavioural measures of the distance their dogs travel in a spatial impulsivity task. The original study (Brady et al., 2018) found that owner ratings of adult dog impulsivity (using the Dog Impulsivity Assessment Scale; Wright et al., 2011) matched levels of impulsivity in a spatial impulsivity task (but not for young dogs).

Comparative Psychology,Temporal preferences in chimpanzees and bonobos,"temporal/time discounting, intertemporal choice, delay choice). Chimpanzees (_Pan troglodytes_) wait longer than bonobos (_Pan paniscus_) in intertemporal choice tasks providing choices between smaller, sooner and larger, later food rewards. Rosati et al.

Evolutionary Linguistics,Typological Prevalence Hypothesis: Learnability of semantics (evidentiality),"Typological Prevalence Hypothesis.** The typological prevalence hypothesis is a proposal that suggests that certain structural features are more common across languages than others due to factors such as ease of learning, processing, and use. These more prevalent structural features are thought to be more likely to be retained in a language over time. Claims that  cross-linguistically more prevalent distinctions are easier to learn, or the more common a certain distinction or way of categorising across languages, the more cognitively natural (and easily learnable) for humans it should be. This effect is explored for the grammatical structure of evidentiality, or grammatical marking of information source in an utterance","Saratsli et al.: NA. Saratsli and Papafragou: NA.
